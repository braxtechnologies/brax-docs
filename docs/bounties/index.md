## 🔎 What is Algora?

Algora is a contributor marketplace for open-source teams. It connects our GitHub issues to bounties so contributors can:

- Discover funded tasks across our repositories
- Claim issues and reserve work directly via GitHub login
- Submit pull requests that automatically link back to the bounty
- Get paid once the work is approved — handled by Algora

All bounties appear on our Algora board and stay in sync with the related GitHub issues.

## 🚀 How to Participate

1. Sign in to Algora with your GitHub account
2. Browse bounties on our board (we’ll link the board from each repository and this page once live)
3. Read the description and acceptance criteria carefully
4. Click <strong>Claim</strong> to reserve the bounty (short reservation window applies)
5. Open your PR against the linked repository and reference the issue (e.g., <code>Closes #123</code>)
6. Respond to review feedback and iterate until approved
7. Once we mark the bounty as <strong>Completed</strong>, Algora processes the payout

> Tip: If a bounty looks ambiguous, ask clarifying questions in the GitHub issue before claiming.

## 🧭 Workflow & Statuses

- <strong>Open</strong> — available to claim
- <strong>Claimed / In Progress</strong> — a contributor is actively working (timeboxed)
- <strong>In Review</strong> — PR submitted and under code review
- <strong>Changes Requested</strong> — updates requested before acceptance
- <strong>Completed</strong> — merged/accepted; payout is triggered in Algora
- <strong>Unassigned</strong> — reservation expired due to inactivity

We may unassign a bounty if there’s no visible progress or communication within the reservation window.

## 📐 Quality Bar & Acceptance Criteria

To keep reviews fast and fair, please:

- Scope your PR to the bounty only (no unrelated refactors)
- Follow repository conventions (linters, formatting, tests, commit style)
- Add tests when applicable; update docs if behavior changes
- Provide a brief PR description explaining the approach and trade-offs
- Ensure the PR references the bounty’s GitHub issue

Submissions are evaluated against the acceptance criteria in the bounty description. If criteria change materially during development, we’ll coordinate this in the issue.

---

## 💵 Rewards & Payouts

- Rewards are listed in each bounty on Algora
- Payouts are released after approval and (typically) merge
- Algora handles invoicing/compliance and facilitates payouts to contributors
- Any applicable taxes/fees are your responsibility as the contributor

If multiple high‑quality solutions land simultaneously, we may award the bounty to the first acceptable PR and (at our discretion) offer partial rewards to others.

---

## 🤝 Communication

- Use the linked <strong>GitHub issue</strong> for questions, design proposals, and status updates
- Prefer early alignment on approach for complex tasks
- If you can’t continue, <strong>comment to release the claim</strong> so others can pick it up

---

## 🔒 Licensing & Contribution Terms

- Contributions are made under the repository’s license
- Some repositories may enforce DCO/CLA — follow the repo’s CONTRIBUTING.md
- By claiming a bounty, you agree to our code of conduct and to deliver original work you’re authorized to submit

---

## 🛠️ For Maintainers (internal)

- Create/triage a GitHub issue with clear acceptance criteria
- Publish it as a bounty on Algora and set the reward
- Link the issue in the bounty and keep scope synced
- Review PRs promptly; mark bounty <strong>Completed</strong> once accepted
