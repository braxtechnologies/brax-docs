# Employee Referral Program Policy

#### Policy brief & purpose

Compared to other recruiting strategies, our employee referral program has a higher return on investment (ROI). Employee referrals are a great way to improve our time, cost and quality of hire. This policy clarifies the conditions for referring candidates to our selection process.

#### Scope

This Employee Referral Program Policy applies to employees who refer a candidate to our company. It does not apply to employees working in the HR department or that are involved in the Selection process, or that were part of a Marketing campaign/initiative.

#### Policy Elements

brax considers referrals the best way to attract talent. We already trust our employees’ judgment at work – why not trust them about who will be a good addition to our team? And given the effect of personal relationships on team spirit, why not count on relationships that are already good? \
Now, we introduce tiers, depending on the position of the referred person. Naturally, some roles are key to our operations and call for a bigger reward if someone tips us off about top talent in these fields.&#x20;

For referring a candidate for a Management position or in the Android Development framework, team members will receive the equivalent of a monthly salary (in NET leva) for the new hire:

* 30% on the new hire's first day of work
* 30% when they make one year in the company
* 40% when they make two years in the company

For referring a candidate for all other IC positions, team members will receive the equivalent of a monthly salary (in NET leva) for the new hire:

* 30% on the new hire's first day of work
* 30% when they pass the probation period in the company
* 40% when they make one year in the company

#### Procedure

In order to refer a person to work in brax, you should communicate with our Recruitment team and share the curriculum vitae of the candidate. A brief explanation of why you believe the person will be a valuable asset to Secure Group may be required for the documentation of the Selection Process.

#### Policy Violation

This policy is optional and there are no consequences if employees do not refer candidates
