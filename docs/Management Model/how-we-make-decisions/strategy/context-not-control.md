# 🧳 Context, Not Control

> **Our mantra:** Give people context, not commands. Trust them to find the best path forward.

## 🎯 The Three Pillars

When building our Management Model, we focused on three core truths:

### 1. 💡 Innovation Drives Value
In a product-led business, innovation is everything. We made it our top priority.

### 2. ❌ Micro-Management Doesn't Work
It stifles creativity and slows teams down. We needed a better approach.

### 3. 🎯 Vision Must Cascade
The company's vision and strategy should be reflected across the entire organization to align everyone's goals.

## 🔄 From Command & Control to Context

We ditched the old command-and-control playbook. Instead, we embrace **Context, Not Control**.

**What this means:**
- Give people the freedom to manage their own tasks
- Trust them to find the best way to support business goals
- Provide insight and understanding so they can make sound decisions

## 🛠️ How It Works

Instead of controlling people, we set clear **context:**

✅ **Strategy** → Where we're going  
✅ **Objectives** → What we need to achieve  
✅ **Assumptions** → What we believe to be true  
✅ **Metrics** → How we measure success  

When people understand the context, they can make better decisions. This leads to high performance.

## 🌱 Why This Matters

**Context, Not Control:**

- 🧒 **Attracts ethical people** who thrive in trust-based environments
- 💡 **Enables creativity** by removing micromanagement barriers
- 🚀 **Drives innovation** when people have the freedom to experiment

But here's the catch: **To innovate, people need to know what we're trying to achieve.** That's why understanding [our Mission & Vision](../../about-us/vision-mission-and-focus/) is critical.
