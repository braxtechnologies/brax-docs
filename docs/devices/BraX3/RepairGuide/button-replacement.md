# Button Replacement

Instructions for replacing power, volume, or other physical buttons.

!!! warning
    Button flex cables are delicate. Apply minimal heat, use plastic tools, and avoid tearing adhesive near microphones or antenna contacts.

## Tools Required
- Phillips #00 screwdriver
- Spudger
- Tweezers
- Plastic picks
- Small double‑sided adhesive strips

## Steps
1. Power off the device and remove the SIM tray.
2. Open the device (back or screen) and disconnect the battery.
3. Remove any shields or brackets covering the side‑key flex connector and disconnect it.
4. From inside the frame, gently peel the button flex from the sidewall; warm adhesive with light heat if needed.
5. Transfer any button gaskets or metal domes to the new flex, or install the new button/flex assembly.
6. Align the new buttons in the frame channels and adhere the flex in place without creases.
7. Reconnect the flex and reinstall shields/brackets.
8. Reconnect the battery and temporarily power on to test all buttons.
9. Close the device with fresh adhesive and perform a final test.

## Notes
- If buttons feel mushy, reseat the domes and ensure the frame channels are clean of old adhesive.
