# 📺 Screen Replacement

Instructions for replacing a damaged or cracked screen.

!!! warning
    This procedure can permanently damage your device if done improperly. Proceed slowly, keep track of screws, and disconnect the battery before unplugging any display flex cables.

## Tools Required
- Phillips #00 screwdriver
- Plastic opening picks/cards
- Suction cup
- Spudger
- Tweezers
- Heat gun or hair dryer
- High‑purity isopropyl alcohol (90%+)
- Precut display adhesive or thin double‑sided adhesive
- ESD wrist strap (recommended)

## Steps
1. Power off the device and remove the SIM tray.
2. Warm the screen edges evenly for 1–2 minutes to soften adhesive.
3. Place a suction cup near the bottom edge; create a gap and insert a plastic pick.
4. Slide the pick around the perimeter to cut adhesive. Avoid inserting too deep near the flex cable areas.
5. Carefully lift the screen slightly and open it like a book; do not pull on the flex cables.
6. Disconnect the battery first, then disconnect the display/digitizer connectors.
7. If transferring components (earpiece mesh, brackets), remove and move them to the new screen.
8. Test-fit: connect the new screen temporarily, reconnect battery, and power on to test touch and display. Power off and disconnect again.
9. Remove old adhesive, clean mating surfaces with isopropyl alcohol.
10. Apply new adhesive, reconnect the display flex(es), then reconnect the battery.
11. Align and press the screen into place with even pressure. Clamp gently for 30–60 minutes if adhesive requires curing.
12. Reinstall SIM tray and perform a final functional test (touch, brightness, proximity sensor).

## Notes
- If adhesive pull is difficult, reapply controlled heat and try again.
- Never pry near the mid‑frame without supporting the glass to avoid cracking.
