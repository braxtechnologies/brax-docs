## Overview
Many devices use a replaceable USB‑C daughterboard that includes the port, microphone, and antenna contacts.

## Steps
1. Power off the device and remove the SIM tray.
2. Open the device (back cover or screen) as appropriate. Remove any loudspeaker module covering the daughterboard.
3. Disconnect the battery.
4. Disconnect coax/antenna cables and interconnect flex cables from the daughterboard.
5. Remove screws securing the daughterboard and lift it out carefully.
6. Inspect for debris or lint inside the port; clean gently if reusing. Otherwise, replace with a new board.
7. Install the replacement board, ensuring pogo pins and gaskets align.
8. Reconnect interconnect and antenna cables; route coax properly to avoid pinching.
9. Reinstall the loudspeaker module and screws.
10. Reconnect the battery, close the device with fresh adhesive if needed, and test USB‑C charging/data and microphone.

## Troubleshooting
- If the device still does not charge, test with another cable/charger and inspect the main board connector and fuses.
- Check for bent pins inside the USB‑C port and for debris blocking insertion.
