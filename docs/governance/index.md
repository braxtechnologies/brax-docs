# ⚖️ We Are Here to Fix Mobile Tech

&nbsp;

## The Problem in the Technology Industry

Closed systems, test planned obsolescence, data exploitation, and environmental harm dominate the industry. Too often, the needs of people, communities, and the planet are neglected in favor of corporate profits.

## Brax Technologies Mission

We believe it doesn’t have to be this way. Technology can be ethical, sustainable, and empowering. At Brax Technologies, we are building a better tech future—one where openness, choice, security, and transparency are at the core.

## User-Centered Products

We design products that put users first, enabling them to control their technology rather than being controlled by it. Together, we can create an ecosystem where technology empowers individuals, protects the planet, and supports collaboration and innovation.

## Our Core Beliefs

### Freedom of Choice Empowers People

Technology should serve its users, not dictate their choices. By creating products compatible with nearly all operating systems, we ensure users can pick the software that aligns with their values and needs.

### Privacy Is a Universal Right

Privacy is fundamental. Everyone deserves access to products that protect their data and support privacy-focused systems, without compromising usability or affordability.

### Security Should Be Transparent and Rigorous

Users deserve trust in their technology. By adhering to open, peer-reviewed security standards and transparent practices, we safeguard user data while allowing external scrutiny to ensure robust defenses.

### Sustainability Is Non-Negotiable

Tech innovation shouldn’t harm the planet. Our products are designed for durability, repairability, and longevity, reducing waste and fostering a circular economy.

### Transparency Builds Trust

Users should fully understand the technology they use. We go beyond features and specs, providing clear and detailed documentation of how our products are designed, tested, manufactured, and maintained.

### Collaboration Drives Progress

We thrive through partnerships with open-source developers, non-profit organizations, and ethical innovators. By sharing resources and profits with these collaborators, we build a stronger, fairer tech ecosystem.
