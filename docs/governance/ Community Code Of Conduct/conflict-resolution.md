# Conflict Resolution

## Overview

The Community Council is responsible for enforcing the Brax Community Code of Conduct. Some of that responsibility is delegated to individual Team Councils and platform moderators to ensure quick and tailored response.

Brax is a large and diverse community, and conflict will naturally arise. The Code of Conduct defines our standards of behavior, but it should not be used as a rulebook to resolve every disagreement. We value a collaborative environment where everyone works to resolve conflict constructively.

This page describes the process to follow when individual attempts to resolve conflict have failed, or are infeasible.

## Before Escalating

### 1. Attempt Direct Resolution

When possible, try to resolve conflicts directly with the involved parties:

- Approach the conversation with empathy and good faith
- Assume positive intent from others
- Focus on the issue, not the person
- Use "I" statements to express your perspective
- Listen actively to understand the other perspective

### 2. Identify the Core Issue

Try to sum up the problem in a very neutral and objective way:

- What specific behavior or action caused the conflict?
- What is the impact of this behavior on you or the community?
- What outcome would you like to see?
- Are there any process flaws that contributed to the situation?

### 3. Document the Situation

Keep records of relevant communications and incidents:

- Screenshots or quotes of problematic behavior
- Dates and times of incidents
- Names of witnesses, if applicable
- Any previous attempts to resolve the issue

## Escalation Process

If direct resolution is not possible or has failed, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Contact Your Team Council or Platform Moderators

If applicable, get in touch with members of your Team Council or platform moderators and describe the situation:

- **Forum Issues**: Contact forum moderators
- **GitHub/Repository Issues**: Contact repository maintainers
- **Chat Platform Issues**: Contact channel moderators
- **Team-Specific Issues**: Contact your Team Council

Provide them with:
- Your neutral description of what is going wrong
- Relevant documentation
- What you've already tried to resolve the issue

### Step 2: Contact the Community Council

If Team Councils or platform moderators were not able to help you sufficiently, you can escalate to the Community Council.

**How to Contact:**
- Email: [community-council@braxtech.net](mailto:community-council@braxtech.net)
- Include your neutral description of what is going wrong
- Provide relevant documentation and context
- Explain what previous steps you've taken

**What to Expect:**
- The Community Council will acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days
- They will investigate the matter thoroughly
- They will decide on the appropriate action
- They will communicate their decision to all relevant parties

## Community Council Responsibilities

The Community Council will:

1. **Investigate Thoroughly**
   - Review all provided documentation
   - Interview relevant parties when necessary
   - Consult with Team Councils or moderators as needed

2. **Respect Privacy**
   - Respect the privacy and security of the reporter
   - Handle sensitive information confidentially
   - Only share details necessary for resolution

3. **Take Appropriate Action**
   - Apply enforcement guidelines from the Code of Conduct
   - Consider the severity and context of the situation
   - Ensure fair and consistent treatment

4. **Communicate Decisions**
   - Explain the reasoning behind decisions
   - Provide clear next steps
   - Document outcomes for future reference

## Types of Conflicts

### Technical Disagreements

Disagreements about technical direction, implementation, or approach:

- **First Step**: Discuss in relevant team meetings or forums
- **Documentation**: Prepare clear technical arguments
- **Resolution**: Technical Board may be consulted for architectural decisions

### Interpersonal Conflicts

Conflicts between community members about behavior or communication:

- **First Step**: Direct communication or mediation
- **Documentation**: Focus on specific behaviors, not personalities
- **Resolution**: May result in coaching, warnings, or other Code of Conduct enforcement

### Process or Policy Disputes

Disagreements about community processes, policies, or governance:

- **First Step**: Raise in community forums or governance channels
- **Documentation**: Propose specific changes or alternatives
- **Resolution**: Community Council reviews and decides on policy changes

## Resolution Outcomes

Depending on the situation, resolutions may include:

- **Mediation**: Facilitated conversation between parties
- **Coaching**: Guidance on appropriate behavior
- **Warning**: Formal warning about Code of Conduct violations
- **Temporary Restrictions**: Limited participation for a specified time
- **Permanent Ban**: Removal from community spaces
- **Process Changes**: Updates to policies or procedures to prevent future conflicts

## Appeals Process

If you believe a decision was made in error or unfairly:

1. **Request Reconsideration**
   - Email the Community Council with new information or arguments
   - Explain specifically why you believe the decision was incorrect
   - Provide any additional evidence

2. **Review Timeline**
   - Appeals will be reviewed within 10 business days
   - The Community Council may uphold, modify, or reverse the original decision

3. **Final Decision**
   - Appeals decisions are final
   - Focus shifts to implementing the resolution and moving forward
