# Project Governance

## Overview

Project Governance at Brax Technologies defines how we manage, oversee, and make decisions about our open source projects. Our governance model ensures transparency, accountability, and community participation while maintaining project quality and direction.

## Governance Principles

### Transparency

- **Open Decision Making**: All major project decisions are documented and publicly visible
- **Public Discussions**: Technical and governance discussions happen in open forums
- **Clear Documentation**: Processes, policies, and rationales are well-documented
- **Regular Updates**: Community kept informed of project status and changes

### Inclusivity

- **Open Contribution**: Anyone can contribute to projects regardless of affiliation
- **Merit-Based Recognition**: Contributions recognized based on quality and impact
- **Diverse Perspectives**: Actively seek input from varied backgrounds and experiences
- **Accessible Participation**: Low barriers to entry for new contributors

### Accountability

- **Clear Roles**: Well-defined responsibilities for maintainers and contributors
- **Code of Conduct Enforcement**: Fair and consistent application of community standards
- **Transparent Leadership**: Leaders accountable to the community
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodic assessment of governance effectiveness

## Project Roles

### Contributors

- Submit code, documentation, bug reports, and feature requests
- Participate in discussions and code reviews
- Follow project guidelines and code of conduct
- Open to anyone in the community

### Committers

- Regular contributors with write access to repositories
- Review and merge pull requests
- Guide technical direction
- Earned through consistent, quality contributions

### Maintainers

- Long-term stewards of project health and direction
- Make final decisions on technical matters
- Ensure project aligns with overall vision
- Mentor contributors and committers
- Responsible for releases and quality

### Project Leads

- Overall project vision and strategy
- Coordinate between projects and stakeholders
- Represent project in broader community
- Facilitate governance discussions
- Appointed by consensus or through established process

## Decision-Making Process

### Consensus-Seeking

- **Preferred Method**: Strive for broad agreement on major decisions
- **Open Discussion**: Issues discussed publicly before decisions
- **Time for Input**: Adequate time given for community feedback
- **Document Rationale**: Record reasoning behind decisions

### Voting Procedures

When consensus cannot be reached:

- **Simple Majority**: For routine technical decisions
- **Supermajority (2/3)**: For significant changes (governance, architecture)
- **Eligible Voters**: Committers and maintainers
- **Voting Period**: Minimum 7 days for major decisions
- **Public Record**: All votes documented

### Escalation Path

1. Technical discussion among contributors
2. Review by committers
3. Decision by maintainers
4. Escalation to project leads if needed
5. Final escalation to steering committee

## Project Lifecycle

### Incubation

- New projects start in incubation phase
- Demonstrate community interest and viability
- Establish basic governance structure
- Duration: Typically 3-6 months

### Active

- Mature projects with stable governance
- Regular releases and maintenance
- Active contributor community
- Full voting rights in governance

### Maintenance

- Projects receiving minimal updates
- Security and critical bug fixes only
- Reduced governance overhead
- Clear communication to users

### Archived

- No longer actively maintained
- Clearly marked in documentation

- Nominated by existing maintainer

### Code Review Process

- All changes require review before merging
- At least one approval from committer/maintainer
- Automated tests must pass
- Documentation updated as needed
- Feedback addressed or discussed

## Release Management

### Version Scheme

- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Clear changelog for each release
- Release notes highlighting major changes
- Beta/RC releases for major versions

### Release Process

1. Feature freeze announcement
2. Testing and bug fixing period
3. Release candidate (if major version)
4. Final testing and documentation review
5. Official release and announcement
6. Post-release monitoring

## Technical Steering

### Architecture Decisions

- Documented using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Community input sought for major changes
- Backwards compatibility considerations
- Long-term maintenance implications

### Dependency Management

- Regular security updates
- Minimal external dependencies
- License compatibility verification
- Supply chain security considerations

## Community Health

### Metrics

We track and report on:

- Contributor diversity and growth
- Response times to issues and PRs
- Release frequency and quality
- Community satisfaction surveys
- Code of conduct incidents

### Support Channels

- GitHub Discussions for Q&A
- Discord/Slack for real-time chat
- Mailing lists for announcements
- Issue tracker for bug reports
- Documentation wiki

## Conflicts and Resolution

### Technical Disagreements

- Encourage respectful debate
- Focus on technical merits
- Document different perspectives
- Maintainers make final call if needed

### Code of Conduct Violations

- Report to designated contacts
- Investigated confidentially
- Appropriate action taken
