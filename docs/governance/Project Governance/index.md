### 2. Types of Governance Areas

| **Product & Business Strategy** | Sponsor defines features, priorities, release schedule, brand, partnerships, monetization, and strategic direction. | Community determines product direction, feature priorities, and business strategy through elected board or consensus. | Shared strategic planning with sponsor and community input on product roadmap and business decisions. |
