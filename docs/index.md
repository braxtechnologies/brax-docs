# Open Source at Brax Technologies

At Brax Technologies we embrace open source as a tool to bring more fairness to software. Applying that principle to our phones, we believe that by publishing as much source code as we legally can, we can build trust with the community, support the software long after the phone is launched and put users in control.

**Because if you can't open it, you don't own it.**

This website is dedicated to the source code of the operating systems that power our Brax phones. That includes, but is not limited to, the Android framework, the Linux kernel and associated binary blobs. Here you will find instructions on how to access the source code and binary blobs of your Brax phone, and learn how you can build your own version of the operating system.

In addition we invite you to take part in our open source efforts, so therefore you will also find instructions on how to contribute code back to us.

Check out the menu on the left to discover what is available for your Brax phone.

## Our Open Source Governance

At Brax Technologies, we believe that transparency isn't just about releasing code—it's about making our entire organizational process visible and participatory. We're proud to be one of the most transparent companies in the open source ecosystem, and we've built our governance model to reflect these values.

### Full Transparency By Default

Unlike many companies that selectively choose what to open source, we've taken a comprehensive approach to transparency:

- **This entire handbook is open source** – Every aspect of how we work, make decisions, manage teams, and grow people is publicly documented in this repository
- **Public decision-making processes** – Our strategy, leadership principles, and team management approaches are documented and version-controlled
- **Open compensation models** – We publish our salary policies and compensation philosophy, bringing unprecedented transparency to how we value work
- **Accessible governance structure** – Anyone can see how we organize roles, operations, and engineering culture

### Community Participation

Our governance model enables meaningful community participation:

- **GitHub-based collaboration** – All our documentation lives in public repositories where anyone can propose changes via pull requests
- **Edit any page** – Every page in this handbook has an "Edit" link that takes you directly to GitHub where you can suggest improvements
- **Issue tracking** – Report problems, suggest improvements, or start discussions through GitHub Issues
- **Version history** – Every change to our policies and processes is tracked in Git, providing a complete audit trail

### Principles That Guide Us

1. **Radical Transparency** – If we can legally publish it, we do
2. **Community First** – We listen to and incorporate feedback from our users and contributors
3. **Long-term Support** – Our open source approach ensures our software outlives any single product cycle
4. **User Control** – Publishing source code and documentation puts users in control of their devices and data
5. **Continuous Improvement** – Our governance evolves based on community input and best practices

### How to Participate

- **Browse our repositories** on [GitHub](https://github.com/braxtechnologies/brax-docs)
- **Suggest edits** to any documentation page using the edit button
- **Join discussions** in our community forums at [community.braxtech.net](https://community.braxtech.net/)
- **Contribute code** following the guidelines in our contribution section
- **Report issues** or propose new ideas through GitHub Issues

We believe this level of openness sets a new standard for corporate governance in the technology industry. When you can see exactly how we work, you can hold us accountable and help us improve.
