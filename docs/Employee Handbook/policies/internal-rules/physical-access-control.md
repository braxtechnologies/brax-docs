**Policy brief & purpose**

Our Access Control policy outlines our rules for receiving visitors at our premises. We want to ensure that visitors will not:

* Pose threats to our premises and property

The policy applies to all employees, contractors, trainees, partners, customers and all other visitors. The access control is granted by one Employee - the Assets Security Agent. In their absence - by the Office Manager. Employees, except the Security Guard and the Office Manager may not allow access to our building to unauthorized visitors.

**Policy Elements**

* Access of Employees

Each Employee shall access the premises with their own access chip. In case of a forgotten or lost chip, you should approach immediately the Assets Security Agent or, in their absence, - the Office Manager. Employees are not allowed to let in their colleagues, that do not have their own access chip on the premises or to exchange their access chips. Each access chip is unique and personal.&#x20;
