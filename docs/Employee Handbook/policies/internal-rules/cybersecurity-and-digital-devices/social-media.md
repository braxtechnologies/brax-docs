# Social media

**Policy Elements**

We want to provide practical advice to prevent the careless use of social media in our workplace. We address two types of social media use:&#x20;

* Using personal social media at work
* Representing our company through social media.

**Using personal social media at work**

You are permitted to access your personal accounts at work. But, we expect you to act responsibly, according to our policies and ensure that you stay productive. Specifically, we ask you to:

* Discipline yourself. Avoid getting sidetracked by your social platforms.
* Ensure others know that your personal account or statements don’t represent our company. For example, use a disclaimer such as “opinions are my own.”
* Avoid sharing intellectual property (e.g trademarks) or confidential information. Ask your manager before you share company news that’s not officially announced.
* Avoid any defamatory, offensive or derogatory content. You may violate our company’s anti-harassment policy if you direct such content towards colleagues, clients or partners.

**Representing our company through social media**

We expect you to protect our company’s image and reputation. Specifically, you should:

* Be respectful.
* Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise when possible.
* Follow our confidentiality and data protection policies and observe laws governing copyrights, trademarks, plagiarism, and fair use.

**Policy Violation**

We manage and monitor all social media postings on our corporate accounts. In case the employee does not follow the Social Media measures, the following actions will be taken:

* Disciplinary action: if a minor violation
* Termination of Employment: if a severe violation

Examples of non-conformity with the employee social media policy include but are not limited to:

* Disregarding job responsibilities and deadlines to use social media
* Disclosing confidential information through personal or corporate accounts
* Directing offensive comments towards other members of the online community
