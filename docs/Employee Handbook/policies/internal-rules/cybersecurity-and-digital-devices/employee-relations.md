# Employee relations

**Policy Elements**

**Before you date a colleague**

Before you decide to date a colleague, please consider any problems or conflicts of interest that may arise. For example, if you’re working with a colleague on an important project, a relationship between the two of you (or a possible breakup) could affect your work.

**When you begin dating a colleague**

HR won’t get involved in your private lives and will always be discrete. You don’t need to tell us if you go on a few dates with a colleague or become involved, as long as there’s no disruption in the workplace or your own work. Also, make sure to:

* Keep your personal issues and discussions out of the workplace.
* Be productive and focused as always.

**Acceptable behavior**

Our workplace is still a professional setting. We expect our employees to treat each other with respect and avoid hindering other people’s work. If you want to express your romantic interest in a colleague, don’t do anything that may embarrass or expose them and always respect their time and choices. If a colleague is persistent in flirting with you and becomes annoying or disturbs your work, ask them to stop and inform your manager if they continue. Please report them to HR if they make unwanted sexual advances. Sexual harassment is prohibited, including seemingly harmless actions.

**Policy Violation**

In case the employee does not follow the Employee relationship measures, the following actions will be taken: [Corrective Action Plan (CAP)](../../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md)
