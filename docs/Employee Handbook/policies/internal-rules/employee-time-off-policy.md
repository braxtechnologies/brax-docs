# Employee Time Off Policy

#### Policy brief & purpose

This policy explains what are the conditions and requirements for employees to have time off from work.

#### Scope

This policy applies to all employees.

#### Policy Elements

**Paid Time off**

Our company will grant 20 days (1.67 days per month \* 12 months) of paid leave. They are to be taken proportionally throughout the year. For E.g. in the end of March you have 3 times (January, February and March) 1.67 days to take. \
We offer 1 extra day for every year you are with Secure Group. The extra day will be available for the employees to request, once they complete each year with us. For example, if one employee starts working in June/2023, then in June/2024 the extra day will appear in the system to be claimed. \
We give a day off on your birthday as a benefit so you can enjoy a day off on the date of your birthday. This benefit is applicable to full-time employees that already passed probation. This benefit does not apply to employees under a CAP, under a notice period, or if the employee presents any behavior that violates our code of conduct.

**Procedure**

You have to request days off by logging a request in BambooHR. The request needs to be done at least 2 weeks prior unless it is an emergency. You must get the request approved by your direct manager before taking these days. After you get it approved, you must sign that request on paper with the Office Manager. It is not permitted to have 2 people from the same team taking days off at the same time. Please try to use your Paid leave throughout the year and not accumulate your entire leave for the end. Unused Paid leave may be passed on to the next calendar year partially. In some cases, an employee may use up all their Paid leave and still need to be absent from work. In such cases, we may consider granting that employee unpaid time off.

**National Holidays**

Our company observes the Bulgarian holidays. These holidays are days off for employees unless a particular department of our company must operate during these days.

**Procedure**

National Holidays have already been registered automatically in BambooHR. There's no action needed by our employees.

**Sick Days**

Our employees may be unable to perform their duties if they get sick. Our company follows legal guidelines that apply to sick days.

**Procedure**

If you are sick, you must inform the Office Manager as soon as possible. They will further inform your direct manager, and log it in BambooHR. You should also inform the Office Manager for how long you’ll be absent.

#### Policy violation

Time off is guaranteed by the Bulgarian Labor Law, therefore there are no consequences when it's required.
