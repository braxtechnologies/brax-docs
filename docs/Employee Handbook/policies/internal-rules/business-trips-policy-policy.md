# Business Trips Policy Policy

#### Policy brief & purpose

Our business trip policy explains what are the conditions for traveling, accommodation, transportation and related expenses when the employee goes out of town for business purpose as well as the criteria for reimbursements.

#### Scope

This policy applies to all employees.In this policy, we refer to ‘travel’ meaning a business trip to a different city than the one we are in.&#x20;

#### Policy Elements

As our employee, you may need to travel for company purposes. This includes trips to:

* Meet with clients or partners.
* Attend events, like conferences, where you’ll represent our company.
* Visit our company’s offices in other locations.
* Give presentations on behalf of our company.

For this kind of travel, we’ll reimburse transportation and accommodation expenses, and we will provide a daily allowance. Employee expenses fall under two categories:

* Expenses that are paid directly by our company on behalf of employees.
* Expenses that are paid by our employees and are reimbursable.

We’ll reimburse all reasonable business expenses, after they are approved, in part or in full as the case may be.

**Legal/ medical expenses**

If you need to travel to countries that need a visa or other documentation to enter, we’ll cover all relevant expenses (excluding expenses for issuing passports). The same applies to medical expenses, like medical insurance for travelers and vaccinations.&#x20;

**Transportation expenses**

When traveling for company purposes, the company books and pays tickets for any kind of transportation. You should cover any additional expenses on your own.

**Local transportation expenses**

When in your destination, you can take taxis to move around the area for business purposes. Always ask for receipts and we’ll reimburse fares for traveling:

* From airport/ stations to your hotel and back.
* To and from every place you go for company purposes (like conference halls, lunches with clients or client offices).

We won’t reimburse transportation expenses for trips to museums or other places for personal purposes.

**Accommodation**

When traveling for company purposes, the company will book the room for you and pay for your stay. We might have negotiated a contract with a hotel to achieve a discount. We won’t reimburse any extra room-related charges incurred.

**Expenses while on a trip**

During a business trip, you’re entitled to a daily allowance to cover for lunch and dinner.&#x20;

**Non-reimbursable expenses**

We won’t reimburse the following:

* Un-authorized service upgrade (e.g. business class or hotel rooms)
* Personal services (massages, beauty treatments, etc.)
* Personal purchases (gifts, clothes, etc.)
* Lost personal property (e.g. luggage)

This list is not exhaustive. Please ask HR about reimbursable expenses before you go on a business trip.

#### Procedure

When you are about to go on work-related trips, the Operations team will typically arrange for most of your accommodation and transportation costs and document these expenses. You need to:

* Document any expenses that our company hasn’t directly arranged for (e.g. taxi fares.) You cannot be reimbursed if you do not provide a receipt.
* You will receive a daily allowance to cover other necessary travel expenses.
* Submit your reimbursement claim or submit an expense report with all necessary documentation. Please submit your claim/report within a week after your trip.

Your manager and HR are responsible for approving reimbursement claims. If they are approved, you will receive your reimbursement next pay period. We’ll investigate any excessive expenses. In cases of consistent falsified or exaggerated claims, we may take disciplinary action.

#### Policy Violation

In case the employee does not follow this policy, the following action will be taken:

* Disciplinary action
