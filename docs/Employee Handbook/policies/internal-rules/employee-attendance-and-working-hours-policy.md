# Employee Attendance and Working Hours Policy

#### Policy brief & purpose

This policy explains what are the criteria for employees attendance and which actions should be taken in case the working hours are not completed.

#### Scope

This policy applies to all employees that are hired under a full-time contract. The employees working in shifts are not eligible for this policy.

#### Policy Elements

**Working hours**

Our employees work five days a week under the conditions of 8-hours working day. You can take advantage of the Flexible Working Time opportunity, which allows you to start work between 08.00 and 10.00 am, and finish work accordingly, from 17.00 to 19.00 unless it is otherwise specified. If you work in the Partner Success department, you will follow a shift schedule as needed.

\
Our employees can take the following breaks at work:

* Lunch breaks. We provide all employees with a 60 min meal break. They need to take it between 12.00 pm and 14.00 pm. Lunch breaks are not included in the working hours. If possible, schedule these breaks in advance so your team will know when you will be unavailable. For certain positions, we may schedule lunch breaks to avoid any negative impact on our operations.
* Rest breaks. Employees can take 2 breaks 15 minutes each during the day. Rest breaks are included in your working hours.
* If you need to perform any kind of work (e.g. a meeting, a call, etc.) we expect you to take your break before or after.

The positions/employees for which flexible working hours are applicable are always determined by an ordinance of the managers. You can have flexible working hours unless otherwise specified. The opportunity for flexible working hours may be at any time withdrawn for certain positions/employees upon the discretion of the managers if they consider that there are objectives, other reasons which require to do so or if the employee is under a [CAP.](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md)\
It is very important to respect any scheduled meetings and attend them on time. You can work overtime only if you were specifically asked to do that, and your role and duties require that. Overtime work shall be in any case performed in compliance with the rules of the labor legislation.

**Employee Attendance**

All employees need to collaborate with their colleagues to do their job. To make this collaboration easier, we expect you to be punctual and follow the schedule you and your manager have agreed on. If you are absent, late on occasion or you need to leave early, you need to have a good reason and must inform your manager.

**What are absenteeism and tardiness?**

* Absenteeism refers to frequent absence from an employee’s job responsibilities.
* Tardiness refers to coming in late, taking longer breaks than you’re entitled to and constantly leaving earlier from work without reason.

You are responsible to record and monitor your working hours.

**Unforeseen absences**

If you can’t come into work one day, notify the Employee Experience Expert as soon as possible. Please record this in BambooHR as quickly as possible. Unexcused or unreported absence for more than three days will be considered job abandonment. We will understand if you have good reasons for being absent, even if you don’t report it. Those reasons involve serious accidents and family or acute medical emergencies. We will ask you to bring us doctor’s notes or other verification.\
The following list includes reasons that we don’t consider good reasons for being absent:

* Waking up late.
* Stopping on the way to work for personal reasons.
* Bad weather.
* Holidays that haven’t been approved.

#### Procedure

If there's any suspicion about drug or alcohol abuse in the workplace, we will ask the relevant employee to leave the office and to return the next day if there's a condition for that. Here are instances that constitute reasonable suspicion:

* Abnormal behavior.
* Physical evidence of drugs and alcohol or observation (including odors.)
* Patterns of failing to complete a task due to confusion or disorientation.
* Reports from colleagues that an employee admitted to using drugs, was seen using drugs or was shown to be under the influence at work.

If you see that your prescription drugs unexpectedly affect your senses, thinking or movements, please ask for time off. To ensure we enforce this policy, we ask managers to keep detailed, verifiable records of drug-related incidents, behaviors or reports.

#### Policy violation

In case the employee does not follow this policy, the following action will be taken:

* Corrective Action Plan [(CAP):](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md) if a minor violation
* Termination of Employment(see page 63): if a frequent or severe violation

Note that if you become inebriated and behave inappropriately towards colleagues, customers or stakeholders, we will terminate your contract immediately.

#### Procedure

* If you are late for work and will arrive before 10h30am, you need to inform your manager and compensate at the end of the working day.
* If you are late for work and will arrive after 10h30am, you need to take half the day-off that will be subtracted from your available paid-leave days and it should be recorded in BambooHR.
* If you need to leave early, you must inform your manager and compensate for the absent hours within a week

**Manager’s responsibility**

* If you manage employees you are responsible to monitor their attendance. If you notice that a team member is consistently late or absent, arrange a private meeting to discuss.
* If you suspect that your team member abuses their sick leave or is wilfully tardy, you should inform HR and start a progressive discipline process.

#### Policy violation

In case this policy is not abode by employees the following actions will be taken: Disciplinary action: if a minor violation Corrective Action Plan [(CAP):](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md) if severe and/or frequent violation
