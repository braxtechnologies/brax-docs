#### Procedure

**What employees can do**

* Lock or secure confidential information at all times
* Shred confidential documents when they’re no longer needed
* Make sure they only view confidential information on secure devices
* Only disclose information to other employees when it’s necessary and authorized
* Keep confidential documents inside our company’s premises unless it’s absolutely necessary to move them

**Confidentiality Measures**

Measures to ensure that confidential information is well protected:

* Ask employees to sign non-compete and/or non-disclosure agreements (NDAs)
* Ask for authorization by senior management to allow employees to access certain confidential information

**Exceptions**

Confidential information may occasionally have to be disclosed for legitimate reasons. Examples are:

* If a regulatory body requests it as part of an investigation or audit
* If our company examines a venture or partnership that requires disclosing some information (within legal boundaries)
* In such cases, employees involved should document their disclosure procedure and collect all needed authorizations. We’re bound to avoid disclosing more information than needed.

#### Policy Violation

In case the employee does not follow this policy, the following action will be taken:

* Disciplinary action: if a minor violation
* Corrective Action Plan [(CAP): ](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md)if a severe violation

We’ll investigate every breach of this policy. We’ll terminate any employee who willfully or regularly breaches our confidentiality guidelines for personal profit. We may also have to punish any unintentional breach of this policy depending on its frequency and seriousness. We’ll terminate employees who repeatedly disregard this policy, even when they do so unintentionally. This policy is binding even after the separation of employment.
