# Moonlighting Policy

#### Policy brief & purpose

The main purpose of this policy is to set out the expectation we have on how employees will treat their work at our business as their primary job and will not allow other jobs to interfere with the performance of the primary job.

#### Scope

* This policy applies to our employees.
* This policy applies to lawful activities. We will take legal action if you use our company’s equipment, resources or information to support any illegal activities.

#### Policy Elements

We want our employees to be transparent about their side jobs so we can prevent conflicts with their main jobs more easily. Our main rule is that our employees must treat their job in our company as their primary occupation. Any other job should come second. With this rule in mind, our employees must not:

* Take up a job or project with our competitors. Doing so will violate our non-compete agreement and we will terminate you.
* Take up a job or project if its working hours overlap with those of their main job. We expect you to use your working hours to work for our company only.
* Take up a job or project that’s so demanding it interferes with the main job duties. For example, if you’re too tired to do your main job properly, you will face negative performance reviews.
* Take up a job or project that could create a conflict of interest. For this reason, we advise against working for or with our company’s clients, vendors or contractors outside your job.

#### Procedure

**What you should do if you want to take up side jobs**

We define a side job as paid, regular work (temporary or permanent) with specific job responsibilities. For example, working at a coffee shop qualifies as a side job if you are expected to work there regularly, regardless of whether you have pre-determined shifts or a fixed number of hours. Managing a business, working as a consultant or advisor to companies and serving as a board member of an organization falls under our definition too.\
When you want to (or have taken) a side job, you must inform HR and your manager to help us ensure you don’t inadvertently violate this policy.&#x20;

**Using company equipment and resources**

Employees must not use company equipment, resources or materials for their outside activities. Using or disclosing our confidential or proprietary information outside the scope of your job with us is prohibited.

#### Policy Violation

In case the employee does not follow this policy, the following action will be taken:

* Corrective Action Plan[ (CAP)](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md)
* Termination of Employment and legal action: if an extremely severe violation
