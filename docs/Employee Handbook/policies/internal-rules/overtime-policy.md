# Overtime policy

#### Policy brief & purpose

This policy explains what are the conditions and requirements for employees when overtime hours are needed/ requested.

#### Scope

This policy applies to all employees that are hired under a full-time contract.\
The employees working in shifts are not eligible for this policy.



#### Policy Elements

Our employees work five days a week under the conditions of the 8-hours working day. In some specific cases, you might need to stay overtime in the office so you can request overtime hours in BambooHR. Our employees can request overtime hours in case:

* Some urgent task needs to be completed
* One project has to be delivered and it requires extra effort
* Every three months, the overtime hours are calculated and the employee will be granted the equivalent amount of time off.

#### Procedure

* You have to request overtime hours by logging a request in BambooHR.
* The request needs to be done as you or your manager realize the need. Please note: if you're the requester, your manager will need to approve the overtime hours.
* You must get the request approved by your direct manager before working overtime.

#### Policy violation

Overtime is guaranteed by the Bulgarian Labor Law, therefore there are no consequences if you require them.
