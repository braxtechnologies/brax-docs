# Ongoing Meetings



### Product Refinement

Product Backlog refinement is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Department collaborates on the details of Product Backlog items. During the meeting, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is held. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Department. However, Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner. The goal of the refinement process is to have a clear understanding of every item so it can reasonably be "Done" within the Sprint time-box.

### Technical Debt session

A technical Debt session is a process that brings value to product quality. Those meetings happen when needed and requested by the Development Department. Their scope is to discuss technical quality-related topics and create a plan for handling the technical debt. At the end of the session, the team should have a clear idea of what is to be done and how it would happen. The Development Department creates diagrams related to the desired solution or if the scope needs further investigation and time - the Product Owner creates a ticket for needed diagrams and documentation for the plan. The ticket has a responsible person and prioritization to enter in development ASAP.

### Problem Review and Retrospective

This meeting happens after we have encountered critical obstacles. We see a continuous cycle of repeated mistakes or unproductive behavior. We discuss what happened and list all the events that caused the issue. We make improvement items that we can act on, related to process, communication, and collaboration. It is essential to keep the focus on the main goal: to find better ways for us to work together.\
We bring transparency for finalization on items through concepts which you will see in the next page.
