# Scrum Events

Scrum has **five events to create regularity** and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed and have a maximum duration. Once a Sprint begins, its length is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. All other events may end whenever they achieve their purpose, ensuring spending an appropriate amount of time without allowing waste in the process. The five events are :

1. The Sprint
2. Sprint Planning
3. Daily Scrum
4. Sprint Review
5. Sprint Retrospective



1. **The Sprint**

**The heart of Scrum is a Sprint**. It is a time-box of t**wo weeks** during which the teams create a **"Done," useable, and potentially releasable product Increment**. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint. Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective. During the Sprint, The Development team works on the Sprint Backlog Items. The Sprint Planning marks its beginning. **During the Sprint:**

* **No changes are mad**e that would endanger the Sprint Goal.
* **Quality goals do not decrease**.
* In case new information comes up and the team learns more under development, **the scope may be clarified or renegotiated** between the Product Owner and the Development Department.

**Sprints have to accomplish something.** Each Sprint has a goal of what to be built, a design, and a flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.

2. **Sprint Planning**

Sprint Planning is **when the team plans what and how to perform as work**. It needs the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint Planning answers the following:

* What can the team deliver in the Increment, which would be the result of the upcoming Sprint?
* How would the team achieve to deliver the Increment that they plan for the Sprint?
* What can the team complete in this Sprint?

**The Development Department works to forecast the functionality** it can develop during the Sprint. **The Product Owner discusses the objective** which should achieve and the Product Backlog items. **The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.** The input to this meeting is the Product Backlog, the latest product Increment, the projected capacity of the Development Department during the Sprint, and the past performance of the teams. The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Department. Only the Development Department can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint. During Sprint Planning, the Scrum Team can also craft a Sprint Goal.

* How will the chosen work get done?

Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the teams decide how it will build this functionality into a "Done" product Increment during the Sprint. **The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.** Enough work is planned during Sprint Planning for the Development Department to forecast what it believes it can do in the upcoming Sprint. The Development Department self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint. The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Department should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

* Sprint Goal

**The Sprint Goal is the objective the team can meet within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog items.** It guides the teams on why it is building the Increment and which items would help to reach the goal. As the Development Department works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. To satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Department expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

3. **Daily Scrum**

**The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed** event for the Development Department. The Daily Scrum happens every day of the Sprint at the same time and place. At it, t**he Development Department plans work for the next 24 hours.** It gives an overview of the progress towards completing the goal and has the intention to optimize the probability of the team to meet the Sprint goal. It has to answer the questions:

* What did I do until this Daily Scrum that helped the teams meet the Sprint Goal?
* What will I do until the next Daily Scrum to help the teams meet the Sprint Goal?
* Do I see any impediment that prevents the teams or me from meeting the Sprint Goal?

**Daily Scrums improve communications, eliminate other meetings, identify obstacles to development for removal, highlight and promote quick decision-making, and improve the Development Department's level of knowledge**. It is a key "inspect and adapt" meeting. The Daily Scrum is an internal meeting for the Development Department, and if others are present, the Scrum Master ensures that they do not disrupt the meeting.

4. **Sprint Review**

During the Sprint Review, **the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about the work done in the Sprint.** Attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. It is an **informal meeting, not a status meeting,** and the presentation has the intention to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

* Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner.
* The Product Owner explains what Product Backlog items have been "Done" and what has not been "Done."
* The Development Department discusses what went well during the Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved.
* The Development Department demonstrates the work that it has "Done" and answers questions about the Increment.
* The Product Owner discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. He or she projects likely target and delivery dates based on progress to date (if needed).
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning.
* A review of how the marketplace or potential use of the product might have changed is the most useful thing to do next.

The Product Backlog may also be adjusted based on the discussion on this meeting to meet new opportunities.

5. **Sprint Retrospective**

The Sprint Retrospective is an **opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to act on during the next Sprint.** The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

* Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, processes, and tools.
* Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements.
* Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

\
During the meeting, every member of the team should answer three questions:

* What did we do well?
* What went wrong?
* What can we improve?

By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint.
