# Learning day

The Learning Day is our knowledge-driven initiative and it occurs on the last Tuesday of each month. It is a whole day dedicated to Learning. We start with breakfast at 9h00 filled with brain booster food and after that, we start the training according to the following formats:

* **Tech Challenges**: consist of a presentation with an instructor that will act as a facilitator for the employee to assimilate the knowledge. After the training, employees receive a Tech Challenge to prove that they are capable of completing tasks relating to what they just learned.
* **Tech Sessions**: consist of a collaboration activity or open format seminar. It can be given by an external trainer and it also comes with a task to be completed that varies from topic to topic.

After the completion of a training session, you will receive a challenge to prove you are capable of completing tasks related to what you just learned. They are usually short exercises to test you.&#x20;
