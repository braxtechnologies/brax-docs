# 📈 Company Knowledge Centricity Level

> **TL;DR:** We measure how well knowledge flows at brax. We're currently at Grades 2-3, aiming for Grade 5 by next year—where finding and sharing information becomes effortless.

## What Is This?

Think of the Company Knowledge Centricity Level as **how naturally knowledge flows through our organization**—whether people can find what they need, when they need it, and actually use it to do great work.

## Where We Are Now

**Current Status:** Grades 2-3 across departments

We've got a decent foundation, but let's be honest—there's still information that's:
- Hard to find when you need it
- Stuck in someone's head instead of documented
- Scattered across different tools and channels

## Where We're Going

### 🎯 Goal: Grade 5 by Next Year

When we reach Grade 5, knowledge becomes second nature:

✅ **No more hunting** for answers
✅ **No more guessing** who to ask
✅ **Everything centralized**, searchable, and actually helpful
✅ **Everyone empowered** to focus on what they do best

This means more time building secure, ethical mobile technology that matters—and less time searching for that one doc someone shared three months ago.
