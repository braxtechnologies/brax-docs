# 📚 Knowledge management

Our knowledge management strategy enables our organization to create, apply, and share information, breaking down silos and increasing the usage of valuable data.

We developed a **culture in which people feel independent and autonomous when working.** We believe traditional rigid management structures do not create a supportive environment, but cause unnecessary stress and distracts employees, which jeopardizes performance. Because of that, **we respect our people's skills and knowledge and support them to pursue the company’s goals in their own way.** This mutual respect between parties is essential to our Knowledge Management strategy and we can only afford this level of trust in our people if we know they are fully capable of doing their work and can fill any knowledge gaps quickly and efficiently.

It's a no-brainer that **knowledge enables us to grow and innovate**. But, it's a fact also that this is easier said than done. Before we reached our ideal Knowledge Management strategy, we faced some problems as the old way we managed information at was inefficient. Information was shared in a fragmented way, through email and messaging apps. When people needed information, they’d go to an expert and ask them, which not only wasted time but would only benefit one person. It was difficult for the person to retain the new information, especially if it was shared in passing conversation or buried among emails. The process was also not being overseen, so embellishments and inaccuracies could slip through, which could jeopardize the information. Finally, when a knowledge gap formed, we had no way to fill it, as the one-to-one nature of knowledge sharing was impossible to scale, and the gap would remain.

After learning from these past mistakes, we then decided where knowledge should NOT be. We realized our **knowledge should be easily accessible by our employees.** It should not be stuck in someone’s head, where it is of no use to anyone but the person - it would even be unhelpful since people would constantly interrupt their work with questions. It should also not be chaotically thrown around emails and messages, where it is impossible to track and collect. Nor should it be dumped in guides and manuals and be forgotten about, becoming obsolete and misleading.

To ensure the effectiveness of our knowledge management strategy we also defined knowledge sharing as criteria in the Levels of our Frameworks so to progress with us, individuals must demonstrate the capability of sharing knowledge in a structured way.
