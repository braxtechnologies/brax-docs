# Knowledge Categories

We organize knowledge into three types. Each serves a different purpose and needs different ownership.

## The three types

### 1. Extensive Knowledge (Your Craft)

This is the **tools, languages, and platforms you need to do your job**. Think: programming languages, design tools, cloud platforms, frameworks, protocols.

- **Who owns it:** You do. It's your responsibility to grow these skills.
- **What we provide:** Context on how we use these tools and where they fit into our processes.
- **Measured by:** The [Knowledge Accountability Index (KAI)](knowledge-accountability-index.md)—your proficiency in the tech stack relevant to your role.

**Example:** A backend engineer needs to know Python, Docker, and Postgres. A designer needs to know Figma and prototyping tools.

### 2. Realm Knowledge (Domain Expertise)

These are the **broader concepts and domains** that shape how we think about problems.

- **What it covers:** Business domains like privacy tech, mobile hardware, open-source ecosystems, developer relations, etc.
- **Who needs it:** Managers and senior ICs who operate across multiple areas.
- **Measured by:** Leadership frameworks that require proficiency in one or more [Realms](realms.md).

**Example:** A product manager working on BraX3 needs to understand mobile hardware constraints, privacy regulations, and user behavior.

### 3. Organizational Knowledge (How We Work)

This is **everything about how Brax operates**:

- What our products do and how they work
- How teams collaborate and ship
- The processes, rituals, and systems we use
- Strategic priorities and how your work connects to them

**Who owns it:** We do—training and onboarding ensure everyone has the context to perform.

**Why it matters:** Technical people need to understand the business. Non-technical people need to understand the tech. Everyone needs to understand the “why.”

## How we share knowledge

People learn in different ways. We support two formats:

1. **Self-serve docs** → Our internal wiki for reference, how-tos, and decision records
2. **Live sessions** → [Learning Day](learning-day.md) for deeper dives, hands-on practice, and Q&A

## What good knowledge management solves

### Problems we avoid:

- **One-to-one bottlenecks** → Experts aren't trapped answering the same question 50 times
- **Lost in chat** → Important context isn't buried in Slack threads
- **Outdated docs** → Pages have owners; stale content gets flagged
- **Tribal knowledge** → Critical info doesn't live in one person's head
- **Onboarding chaos** → New hires get clear paths instead of random tips

### Where knowledge should NOT live:

- ❌ Only in someone's head
- ❌ Scattered across email threads
- ❌ In forgotten PDFs that nobody can find
- ❌ In outdated manuals that mislead more than they help

### Where knowledge SHOULD live:

- ✅ In searchable, tagged, owned documentation
- ✅ In decision records that explain the “why”
- ✅ In runbooks, guides, and templates
- ✅ In the heads of experts—**and** written down for everyone else
