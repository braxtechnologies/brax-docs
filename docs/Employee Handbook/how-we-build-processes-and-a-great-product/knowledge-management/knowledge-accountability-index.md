## 🎯 What Is KAI?

The **Knowledge Accountability Index (KAI)** is our framework for making knowledge measurable and actionable. Once information is systematized and available to everyone, we can measure it—and that means we can include it in performance evaluations.

### How It Works

KAI describes **six grades of ability and competency** for any specific skill or occupation:

- 📊 Ranges from **"Fundamental Awareness"** to **"Expert"**
- 🗺️ Helps you plan your learning journey
- 📈 Lets you compare your proficiency to top performers
- 🎓 Outlines the capabilities and value expected at each level

---

## 💪 Why This Matters

KAI enables us to:

✅ **Centralize understanding** → Get a holistic view of technology trends and capabilities  
✅ **Define knowledge as performance** → Make knowledge a key component of high performance  
✅ **Stay competitive** → Anticipate and adapt to changes with a quantifiable structure

## 🚀 The Impact

**When people are accountable for knowledge, magic happens:**

- Knowledge gets shared more efficiently and productively
- Teams have the context they need to innovate
- We maintain competitive advantage through smarter, faster execution
- Everyone knows exactly what's expected at their level

With the right systems and processes in place, our employees are better equipped to do groundbreaking work.
