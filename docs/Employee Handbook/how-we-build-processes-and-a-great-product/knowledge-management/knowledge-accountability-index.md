# Knowledge Accountability Index

We believe **high-performance is all about accountability:** and that includes accountability in knowledge. Once information is systemized and available to all, it becomes measurable and this allows it to be considered within the employees’ performances. In order to manage the existing knowledge in the company and to promote such accountability, we created a **Knowledge Accountability Index a.k.a. KAI.**

To help us measure competency in a skill, the i**ndex describes the grades of everyone’s ability and competency in a specific occupation.** It is **separated into six grades**, each outlining the capabilities and value to be delivered by the person, and allowing them to plan their learning journey. These range **from “Fundamental awareness” to “Expert”**. The index can be used by an individual to compare their current level of proficiency to top performers in the same occupation and it enables us to:

* Centralize effort to understand technology trends from a holistic view
* Define knowledge as a key component in high performance
* Anticipate and adapt to changes in external/internal environments to obtain/retain a competitive advantage in a quantifiable structure

It's clear that the effective management of knowledge aids competitive advantage. When people are accountable for knowledge it can be shared more efficiently and productively. We have put in place systems and good processes to achieve this so armed with knowledge, our employees are better able to innovate in their work.\
