## 🧐 What Are Realms?

<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid #667eea; border-radius: 6px; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
  <p style="line-height: 1.6; margin: 0;">
    Realms are the <strong>core domains of knowledge</strong> that shape how we think about problems and make decisions. They cover everything from product strategy to supply chain logistics to security practices.
  </p>
</div>

**Why they matter:**

- **For ICs:** You need deep knowledge in your craft (e.g., software engineering). Understanding adjacent realms (product, security) makes you more effective.
- **For managers:** You’re expected to demonstrate proficiency in **one or more realms** relevant to your role. This isn’t optional—it’s part of the leadership framework.
- **For everyone:** Realms give you the vocabulary and context to have meaningful conversations across teams.

**Example:** A product manager working on BraX3 needs depth in **Product Management** and **Manufacturing** realms. An engineering lead needs **Software Engineering** plus **Information Security**.
