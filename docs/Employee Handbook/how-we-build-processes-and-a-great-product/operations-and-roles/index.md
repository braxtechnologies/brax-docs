# ⚙️ Operations and roles

In the ever-evolving world of tech, success often paves the way for growth and expansion. As we aim to make a bigger impact on our industry and community, our organization naturally experiences an increase in size, including a surge in the number of employees and management layers.

However, **with growth comes complexity**, and without proper management, chaos can ensue. Many companies, in an attempt to retain control, resort to adding layers of bureaucracy and administrative processes. While this may temporarily boost productivity and stability, it often hampers the company's ability to respond swiftly to market changes and stifles the creativity of our talented workforce.

Why do most companies curtail freedom and become more bureaucratic as they grow?

The answer is:

* Desire for bigger positive impact creates growth.
* Growth increases complexity.
* Growth also often shrinks talent diversity (people tend to like stability when they realize some sort of chaos).
* Chaos emerges.

Bureaucracy emerges to stop the chaos but drives more talent out.

We are acutely aware of the challenges that growth can bring in a dynamic industry like ours. We believe that there are three paths a company can take when faced with this situation and they are related to avoiding chaos as we grow with even more High-Performance people - not with rules. We will make this happen by those paths:

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Minimize rules as we grow.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Inhibit chaos with even more high performing people.**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Flexibility is more important than efficiency in the long term**</mark>

This means we can continue to mostly run informally with self-discipline, and avoid chaos. Running informally enables and attracts creativity.
