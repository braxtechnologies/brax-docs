# How We Navigate Growth and Complexity

Instead of burdening our teams with a plethora of rules and administration, **we place our faith in our employees' drive and self-discipline**. We grant them the freedom they need to continue working effectively and remaining creative, even as our company expands. For us, the long-term benefits of flexibility and the free flow of ideas outweigh mere short-term efficiency gains.

**Our Approach in Two Simple Steps:**

1. <mark style="color:blue;">**Minimize Rules:**</mark> We believe in minimizing unnecessary rules and processes to make room for superior performance and innovation.
2. &#x20;<mark style="color:blue;">**Attract High-Performers:**</mark> Our emphasis lies in attracting and retaining the highest performers who possess the adaptability and responsibility needed to thrive in our dynamic environment.

#### Embracing Empowering Processes <a href="#epicmap-embracingempoweringprocesses" id="epicmap-embracingempoweringprocesses"></a>

While we recognize that not all processes are bad, we only implement those that empower our employees and promote accountability. Before introducing a new process, we carefully assess its potential impact by asking the following questions:

* &#x20;**Flexibility and Change**: Does the process accommodate changing tactics and circumstances?
* **Eliminating Bias:** Does it help eliminate biases and assumptions, fostering a fair and transparent working environment?
* **Data-Driven:** Can the process be evaluated using both qualitative and quantitative data to determine its effectiveness?
* &#x20;**Clear Goals:** Does it ensure explicit and transparent communication of objectives to all team members?
* **Encouraging Creativity:** Does the process provide teams the opportunity to draw on their creative intelligence?

But then how do we manage our company without lots of rules and administration getting in the way? Simple – we believe that not all processes are bad. For us, a **good process is one that empowers our employees and promotes accountability.** We only add those processes that are absolutely necessary and will not get in the way of our staff.

To minimize the necessary processes and rules, we ask ourselves a few questions before we introduce a new process. We determine whether it:

* Represents the current tactic with full knowledge that the tactic may change
* Tries to eliminate individual biases and assumptions
* Allows us to reflect on what is and isn’t working using both qualitative and quantitative data
* Helps us be explicit and transparent, so that everyone knows what we are trying to accomplish.
* Provides our teams with the opportunity to work flexibly, drawing on creative intelligence.

For cross-department, cross-division, and cross-team processes the same rules apply, with the point of attention that when one employee is handing over a part of a process to another employee in the chain, the relevant part has to also promote accountability.

So only when we answer YES to all those points we add the new process to our Responsibility Assignment Matrixes:

* [RACI for cross-department processes](our-responsibility-assignment-matrixes-raci-and-code-ks.md)
* [CODE-KS for in-department processes](our-responsibility-assignment-matrixes-raci-and-code-ks.md)
