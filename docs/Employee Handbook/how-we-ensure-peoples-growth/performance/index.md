# 📈 Performance

**Providing a concrete and clear development path that leads to a secure and trustworthy environment where innovation can thrive.** This is how we ensure our people's growth and development.\
\
We want employees to:

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Be productive (to deliver value quickly)**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Be autonomous (to drive outcomes)**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Be inspired and motivated (to create and thrive)**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Be psychologically safe (to experiment and fail without feeling vulnerable)**</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Be constantly growing (to achieve mastery)**</mark>

\
That's why, we decided to create a development path that would align with culture, would work for employees from diverse backgrounds, at all levels of experience, and in many different (some unique) roles.

For IT knowledge-driven company, the brain of employees is the biggest asset. To maintain a High-Performance Culture we believe in taking decisive steps not to recruit or retain employees with average performance.
