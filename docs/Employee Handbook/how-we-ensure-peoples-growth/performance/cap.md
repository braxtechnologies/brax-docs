# CAP

Even though we strive to gather dedicated and reliable people, we realize **sometimes people can lose their focus on our mission**.

To help re-establish the link between our goals, we have implemented the **Corrective Action Plan – or CAP**. It is a procedure that highlights areas in which an employee needs to improve and asks them to come up with an action plan for this. This way we give our people a chance to realign with our culture and take corrective action before we take further measures.

The current digital landscape is ripe with errors that can be exploited and can put users’ data at risk. We imagine a world in which the digital privacy of individuals is in their own hands, and we have a plan to build that future. We cannot do it alone - we need the right people to support us on this journey of growth and innovation. brax is a demanding workplace, but also one that will allow you to express your greatness, work the way you perform best, and push you to your limits.
