# Management Model Golden Rules

Our Management Model has some Golden Rules to ensure high-performance of our people.

### On Progression or Stagnation in the Framework

Level and Step Reviews can be requested at any time, but we require that employees undergo at least one evaluation per year. Any less than that is unacceptable

* For Individual Contributors: If you start at brax as a Level 1 or 2, you will have one year to Level UP.
* For Individual Contributors: If you start at brax as a Level 3, 4, 5 or 6, you will have one year to at least Step UP.
* For Managers: If you start at brax as a Step 1 or 2, you will have one year to Step UP.
* If you start at brax in the Level A Path, you will have one year to grow and become a Level 1 on your chosen framework, including proficiency in the KAI of the framework.
* If you are an average performer (defined as having 2 failed [K-POCs ](k-poc.md)in a row) we will let you go.



### On the assigned Level upon hiring:

* You can apply for positions that are a maximum of one Level UP from your assigned Level.
* If you were hired for the Management Path, you can only score Level A during your probation period, unless you were hired for the Level A Path specifically.
* If you do not meet the expectations of the Level you were assigned upon hiring, there are two possible outcomes:\

  * We make you an offer at the salary of your Level, and you will get a K-POC with clear instructions on how to Level UP in the months ahead.
  * You can refuse, and we will let you go.\


### On Salary increase based on the market

* If your Framework had an increase based on the market, in your next evaluation, we will re-adjust your salary according to the new Salary Grid. We expect you to step up one in this scenario.

### On changing Paths

When changing the path, there are 3 criteria to be followed:\


* Job has to be big enough: meaning, is there the need of a person with your seniority for the role at that moment?
* You have to be a superstar in your current role
* You have to be an ambassador of our Management Model

\


### On changing Frameworks/Roles - triggered by the employee

When you wish to change frameworks, there are some criteria to be followed:\


* Job has to be big enough: meaning, is there the need of a person with your seniority for the role at that moment?
* You have to be a superstar in your current role
* You have to be an ambassador of our Management Model
* You will be assigned a K-POC related to the new framework, and you need to accomplish it before officially changing frameworks.

### On changing Frameworks/Roles - triggered by the company

If there's a change in some department or division and the company needs to relocate employees under new frameworks or roles, there are some criteria to be followed:

* The company will offer a new contract with a new probation for the employee
* The company will only make the change official once it's agreed with the employee
* The employee will be assigned a K-POC related to the new framework or role and needs to accomplish it during probation



### On creating the K-POCs

* If the improvement is RACI/CODE-KS related, the management will provide detailed instructions on how to execute/document/follow the relevant process so the employee can work on the objective
* If the improvement is KAI related, the employees can propose any objective they want, as long as in the end, they are able to execute a practical task based on the item of the KAI
* If the improvement is on mindset/attitude level (Level & Step Chart), the employees should come up with any strategy as they feel effective to Level Up - Management will point out what the gap is and the deadline so the employee can work on their personal plan - if the employee reached the expected improvement or not, it will be up to manager's evaluation supported by situations and cases officially reported in our systems (Feedback session of Small Improvements, for example)

**Growth is not linear nor streamlined, therefore our competency matrix is not a checklist, it’s a guideline, and smaller deviations are to be expected.**
