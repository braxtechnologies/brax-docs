🌍 Global Compensation Philosophy

At Brax, we believe that paying people well builds a high-performance culture — one where our team members feel valued for their great work, regardless of where they live or work.

Our guiding principle is simple:

Top performance deserves top compensation — everywhere.

We strive to offer market-leading salaries for every role in every country we operate in. This ensures that each employee can focus on doing their best work without anxiety about financial security or pay equity.

💎 Why Top-of-Market Pay Matters Globally

Salary is an essential consideration for everyone — we all have personal needs, family commitments, and local living costs. Brax’s goal is to minimize the stress and uncertainty that often come with job searches and salary negotiations.

By paying at the top of each local market, we guarantee our team members receive highly competitive compensation in their country, adjusted for cost of living, taxation, and currency differences.

This approach allows candidates and employees to make decisions based primarily on values, skills, and mindset fit, rather than on who offers the highest paycheck.

We believe one outstanding individual can achieve more — and deliver greater value — than multiple average performers. That’s why we skip unproductive back-and-forth salary negotiations and instead put forward our best offer upfront.

🌐 Attracting and Retaining Global Talent

Offering top compensation helps us attract and retain exceptional professionals across the world. We want the brightest minds to join our mission — and we’re ready to reward their contribution fairly, whether they work from Sofia, São Paulo, or Singapore.

Pay transparency and consistent methodology ensure all team members understand how their compensation is determined and how to grow within the company.

💬 Transparency and Fairness

We know that salary discussions can sometimes cause tension or distraction within teams. At Brax, we minimize this by being open about our compensation systems.

Our employees can review how salaries are calculated, how market benchmarks are applied, and how growth opportunities are defined. Everyone can see that pay is determined objectively and consistently, which helps build trust and eliminate toxic workplace behavior.

💰 Compensation Framework Across Countries

Paying at the top of the market is not a slogan — it’s an ongoing process. We continuously monitor local and international labor markets to ensure our salaries reflect current realities.

We benchmark compensation in each country using:

Local Market Data (LMV): Based on trusted regional salary surveys, recruiting partners, and public data sources.

Global Market Value (IMV): Referencing international platforms like PayScale and Glassdoor to align with global IT industry trends.

Cost-of-Living and Tax Adjustments: Ensuring net pay is competitive after factoring in currency, taxes, and purchasing power.

This guarantees fair and competitive pay no matter where you are in the world.

🔁 Compensation Review

At Brax, compensation is dynamic and responsive to market changes:

We review market data regularly, especially before new hires.

If the market value for a position increases, all employees in that role worldwide receive an adjustment.

Pay updates happen automatically — no need to request or negotiate.

Employees can trust that their compensation keeps pace with the top of the market, not only at the time of hiring but throughout their career at Brax.

📈 Compensation Over Time

We maintain competitiveness through:

Regular benchmarking against global and regional competitors.

Collaboration with international recruitment agencies and compensation experts.

Adjustments for inflation, exchange rates, and economic shifts.

Some markets evolve faster due to specific skill demand; our pay structure adapts accordingly. We also ensure internal equity so that people with comparable skills and performance receive comparable pay across countries.

🧭 Compensation Based on Personal Success

We reward personal excellence and growth, not just tenure or company results.
Regardless of whether Brax is thriving or facing challenges, top performers are always recognized and rewarded.

When new employees join at a higher market rate, we review and adjust compensation for others in the same role to ensure fairness and alignment.

This creates a culture of continuous growth and reward, where commitment and performance are directly linked to tangible outcomes.

🚀 Growth, Mobility, and Knowledge Sharing

Growth is in Brax’s DNA — both as an organization and for every individual.
We move fast, adapt often, and value people who thrive in this dynamic environment.

When employees move across countries or take on broader responsibilities, we reassess their compensation to reflect:

The new local market value,

The cost of living and taxation, and

The scope of their new responsibilities.

All processes are well documented in our knowledge base, ensuring smooth onboarding and consistent practices globally.

⚖️ Transparency and the Salary Grid

Some companies hide compensation data to save costs. We believe the opposite — transparency drives trust and performance.

Employees can access Brax’s global salary grid and formulas to understand how compensation is calculated in each location and how progression works.

📊 Example Global Compensation Formulas
For Individual Contributors:
Compensation = max(LMV, IMV adjusted for cost of living and taxes)


Where:

LMV (Local Market Value): Highest salary from trusted local data sources (e.g., Zaplatomer, recruitment agencies), plus a 10% buffer.

IMV (International Market Value): Global benchmark adjusted for cost of living and tax (for example, 38% deduction for U.S.-based salaries).

Compensation bands are defined in local currency, with clear progression rules between levels and steps.

For Management Positions:
Compensation = (Highest Announced International Salary × Tax Adjustment × Cost-of-Living Multiplier)


HAS: Highest published salary for equivalent role on global platforms (PayScale, Glassdoor).

Tax Adjustment: e.g., 38% deduction for U.S. taxes.

COL Multiplier: Local cost-of-living adjustment (e.g., 0.75 for Sofia).

Each level and step corresponds to a global grid for transparent progression.

🌱 Empowering Career Growth

We give every employee the tools to:

Understand their compensation.

Plan their career progression.

Verify calculations through transparent formulas and data sources.
If someone finds a discrepancy, they are encouraged to challenge it — that’s part of our commitment to fairness.

Our Management Model outlines how skills, experience, and results translate into levels, steps, and compensation across all countries.

🏁 Summary

At Brax, compensation is:

Globally fair, locally competitive.

Transparent and data-driven.

Linked to performance, growth, and contribution.

By paying at the top of each market and empowering people to understand and own their career trajectory, we reinforce our commitment to excellence — building a truly high-performance global culture.
