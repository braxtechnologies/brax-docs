# 🌟 Empowering Growth through Transparent Management: Your Path to Success

In the dynamic and ever-evolving world of the technology industry, our **Management Model thrives on one essential pillar – transparency.** We firmly believe that credibility rests on the belief and trust people have in our approach. We foster a winning mentality, trusting our employees to achieve top performance while providing them with a supportive environment for personal and professional growth.

Transparency is at the core of our unique business model. Unlike many companies that shroud performance expectations and compensation rules in confusion, we take pride in being transparent about what we expect from employees. Salaries policy is publicly available, ensuring everyone knows what to expect in terms of career progression and success criteria. We firmly believe that openness fosters a sense of fairness and trust within an organization.

Salary rules should be kept simple and easily understandable, based on levels, and made public knowledge. We believe that employees have a right to know where they stand in terms of compensation and career advancement, creating a knowledge meritocracy where everyone can aspire to reach their potential.



### Embracing Turnover with a Growth Mindset

We acknowledge that **turnover is a natural part of the business landscape** and cannot be addressed solely with "golden handcuffs." Instead, we choose to embrace turnover and be transparent about it, ensuring that the remaining employees feel safe and supported. We believe in celebrating the contributions of those who leave on good terms, valuing their positive impact during their time with the company.

To mitigate the impact of turnover on customers, we redesigned the business model to create multi-person teams, reducing dependency on individual contributors. By documenting every process, we ensure knowledge retention within the company, minimizing the loss of expertise when an individual leaves. For managerial roles, we believe in Long-Term Incentives, recognizing their critical role in developing tacit knowledge and fostering high performance within their teams.

### Performence with Purpose

Transparency extends to all aspects of our business, including performance evaluation. We understand that high performance can mean different things for different individuals and companies. That's why we provide a clear development path for all employees. By knowing roles, responsibilities, and growth opportunities, people are empowered to take control of their career trajectory.

This wiki is designed to increase employee freedom while ensuring alignment with the company's mission. By defining clear behavior and knowledge sets that lead to career success and higher compensation, we empower employees to chart their own course to success.



### A Journey of Continous Improvement

Our commitment to transparency doesn't end with the present state of the wiki. We recognize that growth is a perpetual journey, and we are dedicated to continuous improvement in all aspects of our operations. **Learning from past mistakes, we embrace change and progress to achieve greater heights.**

As you embark on your journey, we want you to know exactly what to expect. **Transparency is the foundation of the relationship with employees, customers, and partners.** As we share knowledge and experiences on this book, we strive to foster a win-win relationship, where everyone thrives.

We advocate so transparency is not just a buzzword; it is a guiding principle, shaping culture and defining organizations. Together, we can embrace transparency and unlock the boundless potential for growth and innovation. Nothing is set in stone, and as we grow and evolve, transparency remains our compass, guiding us to a future filled with endless possibilities. We foster a mentality of learning from past mistakes and we are committed to continuous improvement in all we do.
