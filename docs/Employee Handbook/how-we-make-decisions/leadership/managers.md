# Managers

We currently have **4 leadership Levels** with different expected traits but similar objectives: l**ending support to addressing the needs and wants of the people and the organization**. This is our priority. This contrasts with the leader-first perspective, where a person aims to gain control quickly, often driven by material gain or influence but it’**s our way to ensure autonomy, accountability, innovation and high-performance.**

The core duty of a manager Level 1 is to **get the work done through process management.** They are in contact with customers, suppliers and employees of all levels, therefore they need to navigate frequently between difference audiences to set-up the right context. Our Level 1 managers are required to deliver **fast results.** These leaders are primarily **focused on performance.** They often **set high standards** and hold their colleagues accountable for hitting the department’s goals. The fast-paced work environment fostered by them can also create miscommunications so to ensure effectiveness they have to be able to provide clear instructions and have an outstanding ability to manage adversities, chaos and change.

Our Level 4 Managers ar**e responsible for setting strategic direction, developing context and fostering our corporate culture in an organizational level.** They focus on clear communication, goal-setting, and the company’s productivity.

However, they are als**o committed in developing the next generation of leaders and build a strong relationship with our shareholders.** These Managers also value the company’s ethics and teams while focusing on high-performance in the long-term.
