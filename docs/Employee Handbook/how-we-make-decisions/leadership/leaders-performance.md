# Leaders Performance

So, we have learned that brax has managers at four levels: L1, our pace setters; L2, our coaches; L3, our visionaries; and L4, our transformational leaders. Each level has four steps that a leader can grow into. We also have our [Tech leads](tech-leads.md) who are our leaders in terms of operations.\
\
To progress within our organization, leaders have **two pathways for advancement:** \
A. **Level Up,** which aligns with the nature of their role, or\
B. **Step Up,** which reflects their performance as managers.&#x20;

It's essential to foster a culture that encourages them to continuously strive for growth and aim higher, facilitating their transition from one Level or Step to the next.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To ensure readiness for these transitions, **we recommend thorough evaluations,** defined here as Level & Step reviews, which assess leaders across four key criteria:&#x20;

1\. Technical Leadership\
2\. People Management Leadership\
3\. Business leadership, and \
4\. Adaptive Leadership.&#x20;

\
Each criterion is further divided into Completeness and Achievement sections, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities and accomplishments.

&#x20;

### Technical Leadership - the focus of Managers Level 1 (the Pace setters)

Technical Leadership encompasses the technical skills and know-how of leaders, which are closely connected to Process Management, Knowledge Management, and Team Management models.

* **Completeness**: focuses on how effectively leaders manage processes. It considers their ability to establish, enhance, and adapt processes to drive efficiency and productivity.
* **Achievement**: centers on performance and accountability. We assess how leaders continuously improve and adapt their technical knowledge to meet the evolving demands of their roles.



### People Management Leadership - the focus of Managers Level 2 (the Coaches)

In today's dynamic workforce, understanding and effectively managing diverse employees is paramount. Our solution revolves around the concept of:

* **Completeness:** the ability of a manager to seamless mapping positions within the company to achieve performance goals and project completion.
* **Achievement**: managers need to ensure that the right individuals are in the right roles, offering them ample opportunities for continuous growth and development. By nurturing talent and empowering them to thrive, your company will reach new heights of productivity and innovation.



### Business Leadership - the focus of Managers Level 3 (our Visioneries)

Business Leadership encompasses the skills and abilities required to find business opportunities, overcome strategic challenges, and create a supportive context for subordinates and stakeholders.

* **Completeness:** focuses on the leader's support in developing and completing strategic initiatives, as well as defining, monitoring, and reporting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). It assesses how effectively leaders contribute to the strategic planning and execution processes
* **Achievement:** relates to the team's successful attainment of KPIs and goals, through the effective execution of initiatives. It evaluates how leaders drive their teams towards achieving business objectives and delivering measurable outcomes.

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to these factors, we also recoomend **Capability Assessment**, which measures the likelihood of success and execution of the strategy. This involves evaluating the leaders' ability to excel in their core responsibilities by effectively assessing their team's and division's capabilities to manage campaigns, business plans, projects, initiatives, and achieve business goals.
{% endhint %}

&#x20;**Capability Assessment** is further divided into two sub-categories:

* **General Factors:** This includes **possessing the necessary technical knowledge for the role,** understanding the domain of their team, and assessing the feasibility of their team's technical knowledge within the broader company context.
* **Internal Factors**: This pertains to **the leaders' understanding and familiarity with the company's unique identity, values, and offerings.**

{% hint style="info" %}
Furthermore, **Opportunity Finding** plays a crucial role in Business Leadership. **Leaders must possess the ability to identify potential business opportunities** and effectively address challenges.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We divided this through **two sub-categories: Experience,** which evaluates the leaders' past experiences in recognizing and seizing opportunities, **and Exposure**, which measures their level of exposure to different business contexts and challenges.

* **Experience:** We recognize that invaluable learning and skill development occur through on-the-job experiences. Leaders who have navigated cross-departmental projects, engaged with stakeholders, and handled complex tasks possess a deep understanding of how their roles intertwine with others within the organization. When assessing candidates during the hiring process, we prioritize their relevant experiences in line with our business goals. This enables us to identify individuals who bring valuable insights and perspectives to our IT product landscape.
* **Exposure:** Adaptability is paramount in the ever-changing world of technology. Top leaders must possess the ability to reinvent themselves in the face of challenges and stay updated on market and industry trends. We assess a leader's level of exposure to the unique challenges we encounter in our business domain. Additionally, we recommend evaluating how they approach problem-solving in unfamiliar situations. Even if a candidate or employee hasn't directly encountered our specific challenges, we appreciate proactive efforts to seek exposure and gain insights into similar situations.

By evaluating Business Leadership you gain valuable insights into the strengths and areas of growth for leaders in driving the success of your organization.



### Adaptive Leadership - the focus of Managers Level 4 (the Transformational leader)

In a fast-moving industry like Tech things can change quickly and bring a certain amount of chaos. Those situations require our staff to adapt fast, which can be a challenge. These are the situations in which a true leader can shine. We consider 6 perspectives for success in this issue:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>GET ON THE BALCONY</strong><br>This is the leader’s ability to distance themselves from the situation and take a birds-eye view. This allows them to see the bigger picture and act in an objective way, which is most beneficial to the company.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>IDENTIFY ADAPTIVE CHALLENGES</strong><br>Finding opportunities that require people to learn in an adaptive way and open their minds to new possibilities and ways of doing things.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>REGULATE DISTRESS</strong><br>Supporting the transition of employees during challenging times of change, by managing the pressure on them and their stress.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>MAINTAIN DISCIPLINED ATTENTION</strong><br>To ensure maximum focus, a leader should bring attention to what is important and shield the team from disruptive distractions.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>GET THE WORK DONE</strong><br>Motivating people and directing the workflow to make sure the work is done efficiently.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>PROTECT VOICES FROM BELOW</strong><br>Be inclusive and allow the opportunity to experiment with everyone and be capable of weighing their voices.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

\
Regardless of their Level or Step, we believe **leaders have a crucial role in the operation of an orgnization.** Just as with other employees, they should be held accountable for their work and their performance, and only through excelling at their tasks can they rise up the Management Path. **The requirements are challenging, but only because excellent leadership is so important to the industry landscape.** \
