# 🏹 Leadership

We have seen that by setting **the right context,** e**mployees can understand the company's mission and vision** and create a great product. However, the leadership style in the companies need to support this. Regardless of your role, to ensure effective people management and growth, **you should strive to shift away from "controlling activities" towards a synergistic relationship** between team members. Within complex organizations, leaders need to ensure that the team is heading in the right direction and that any changes throughout the organization will be handled effectively, with minimum disruption to our performance.&#x20;

What makes a good leader is a concept that can vary per team, organization and people's personal opinion. However, in a[ "Context, not Control"](../strategy/context-not-control.md) environment, you still need people to coach and provide directions, but this is not the traditional role of a leader. That’s why we believe that they key to success is to always l**ook for the ones that can embrace the core principle of caring for others and giving up control rather than seeking control.**

At brax, we have two types of leaders: [Managers](managers.md) and [Tech Leads](tech-leads.md). Learn more about them and what do you need to become one in the next chapters.
