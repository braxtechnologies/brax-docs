# Strategic Sessions: Empowering Innovation

Strategic Sessions are **designed to spark ideas and solve problems** that drive us towards our objectives. Led by managers, these sessions consist of two vital stages:

**Discussion stage 1: Problem Framing**\
The goal of this stage is to define a single problem statement, which needs to answer these questions:

* <mark style="color:blue;">**Who**</mark> - Who has this problem? Can they validate that the problem is real? Can they prove it?
* <mark style="color:blue;">**What**</mark> - What is the nature of the problem? What research or supporting evidence can be provided?
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Why**</mark> - Why is the problem worth solving? What is the impact on the customer?
* <mark style="color:blue;">**Where**</mark> - Where does this problem arise? Has someone observed this problem occurring?

**Discussion stage 2: Analysis of strategic goals and definition of initiatives to address the problem**\
\
This stage deals with defining how the problem impacts our strategic goals and how to find the best way to solve it.
