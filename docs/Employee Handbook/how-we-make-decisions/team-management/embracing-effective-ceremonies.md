# Embracing Effective Ceremonies

**To foster open communication, accountability, and minimize micro-management,** we employ structured touchpoints, or **ceremonies**, that keep everyone informed about company happenings. These ceremonies are essential for our success, as they:

1\.     **Eliminate Hierarchical Barriers:** Unlike traditional top-down communication, we empower every employee to communicate directly with others, regardless of rank or level. This approach ensures that information flows freely without any loss or distortion.

2\.     **Foster Collaboration and Innovation**: Strategic Sessions are a core part of our ceremony framework. These sessions enable teams to collaborate, exchange ideas, and find innovative solutions to achieve our business goals.\


Most traditional companies have a hierarchical, top-down structure of communication, in which the lower-level employees communicate with their leader/manager, who then shares information to their superior and to other managers connected to the project. This leads to slow communication and can result in some information being lost or changed in the process.

In brax, **we don’t use intermediaries and message carriers**. Instead, **every employee has the chance to talk directly to every other employee-related to their project to share information and updates, regardless of rank or Level.** The role of the leader in this structure is not to pass messages around, but to guarantee that both parties reach an agreement that will help brax reach its goals.\
