# 👭 Team management

In the fast-paced world of tech companies developing cutting-edge mobile products for a global audience, **effective team management is the key to success**. Just like you, we understand the importance of [Strategic Management](../strategy/strategic-management.md) in driving our business forward. But we also firmly believe in empowering our workforce through [Context, Not Control](../strategy/context-not-control.md), which has proven to be a winning leadership style.

As our teams continue to grow at an exponential rate, providing the right context for every team member becomes a challenge we must address head-on. The key lies in striking a **balance between Strategic Management and Leadership**. **Our leaders** are not just taskmasters; they **are strategic thinkers** who guide the team towards achieving common goals. To achieve this, we follow some core principles:

* **accountability for deliverables:** We hold ourselves accountable for meeting deliverables, ensuring that everyone knows their responsibilities.
* **following Up on deliverables:** Deliverables aren't just set and forgotten; we proactively follow up to track progress and provide necessary support.
* **coaching and assistance**: Our leaders are here to help and coach the team, fostering a collaborative and growth-oriented environment.

At the same time, **we understand the importance of providing context to our employees**. Our leaders play a vital role in:

Of course, in the tech industry, data breaches and information leaks are constant concerns. To combat this, we emphasize accountability between teams and individuals through robust processes that prioritize data security.
