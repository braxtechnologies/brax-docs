# Strategic management

**Strategic management is the ongoing planning, monitoring, analysis and assessment of all that is necessary for an organization to meet its goals and objectives.**

In today's fast-paced business world, success often hinges on the ability to adapt to new challenges. That's why we've developed an innovative approach to addressing adaptive challenges on a departmental level, with a **focus on clear communication and top-to-bottom visibility.** By aligning day-to-day work with strategic goals, prioritizing projects and products, and monitoring progress towards key performance indicators, we're able to achieve the most ambitious objectives.

With a deep understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by different departments, our approach allows us to **create a comprehensive strategy that fosters maximum performance and empowers teams to excel.** By emphasizing [context over control,](context-not-control.md) we create a supportive environment that allows for creativity, collaboration, and continuous improvement.&#x20;

When it comes to managing projects, technology companies need a tool that can keep up with their fast-paced, dynamic environment. That's why **we recommend Project Management tools like Jira** - a versatile, user-friendly platform that helps us stay on top of all our projects, no matter how complex or varied.

Our unique approach to using Jira **ensures that all employees have visibility into which part of the strategy their tasks are affecting**, regardless of department or project type. Here's how we break it down:

* **Department projects:** these tasks are directly related to improving the processes within a specific department, and are all linked to an initiative that addresses an adaptive challenge.
* **Cross-department process projects:** these tasks involve improving processes that cross multiple departments and are typically company-wide initiatives.
* **Product projects:** these tasks relate to all aspects of our products, from bug fixing and feature development to product stories and overall improvements.

By organizing our projects using **Kanban and Scrum boards**, we're **able to ensure that everyone is on the same page** and working towards the same strategic goals.&#x20;

In conclusion, when Strategic Management is done right:

* Strategy and goals are clear, specific and globally understood.
* Team interactions are focused on strategy and goals, rather than tactics.
* Management time is transparent, articulate and perceptive

However, to ensure security in all aspects, there're some situations where **control is required:**\


* When we need to prevent irrevocable risks, ie. possibility of data breaches.
* When people are still learning they need mentoring: junior employees
* When there are escalated conflicts: Moral, Ethical and Legal issues.
