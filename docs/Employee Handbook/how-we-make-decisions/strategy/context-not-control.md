# Context, not control

We focused on **three things** while creating our Management Model:

* **innovation** drives the most value in a product-led business, so we made it the main priority
* **micro-management doesn't work,** so we need a more effective approach
* the company’s business **vision and development strategy needs to be reflected** across the whole company to align teams’ goals

As a result, we replaced the command and control approach with a **Context, Not Control mantra**. This approach gives talent the freedom to manage their tasks and find the best way to support the business' goals.&#x20;

We believe in **Context, not Control** to provide the insight and understanding **to make sound decisions**. Setting appropriate context such as company's strategy, objectives, assumptions and metrics, rather than by trying to control people leads to High Performance. We believe **this will also attract ethical people** and give them the environment to be creative and innovative. But, to enable innovation, people need to know and understand what the company is trying to achieve ([the Mission & Vision](../../about-us/vision-mission-and-focus/)).

So the questions remains... how should we manage projects, without micro-managing teams and still keeping the focus on innovation?  With the help of a Strategic Management model. And that is why we created this material - to empower and manage high-performing people with the freedom to make a big impact.
