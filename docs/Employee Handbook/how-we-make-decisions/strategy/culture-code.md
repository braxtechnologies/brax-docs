# Culture code

**brax has innovation at the center of our business so people need to deliver it.** That's also why we embrace diversity. Being innovative requires people from different backgrounds with different ideas, and we want to get the best from everyone.

This diverse community of bright people from different backgrounds work together to achieve a shared goal. To achieve this **we need to share the same set of corporate values**, regardless of background.

Therefore, to ensure that everyone is working towards the same vision, we've developed a **Culture Code.**&#x20;

Our Culture Code is built on 6 essential permission to play values that we believe are essential to our business model.

Permission to play means exactly that: minimum standards of behavior we expect within our "free to create" environment.

We only hire people that demonstrate these values, and we don't tolerate employees who don't exhibit these values.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Even though we strive to gather dedicated and reliable people, we realize sometimes people can lose their focus on our mission. We are all human and prone to mistakes from time to time. Occasionally during hiring, someone who is not a good culture fit will slip through the net. We need a way to manage these culture mismatch scenarios. You may have a high performer at a technical level in your team, but what if he/she doesn't embrace the culture? We believe it is fair to give everyone a second chance. We work to the premise that people can change – and we developed a process called [Corrective Action Plan (CAP)](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md) to manage this. The CAP also provides a last opportunity for the employee to reflect if the job is right for him/her.

This procedure clearly sets out the behaviors and attitudes that need improving and asks them to come up with an action plan for themselves. This way we give people a chance to realign with our culture and take corrective action before we take further measures.

However, we understand that this journey cannot be traveled alone. We seek out individuals who share our commitment to ethical innovation, inviting them to join us in our quest to redefine the boundaries of digital privacy and security. Together, let's build a safer, more responsible digital world.
