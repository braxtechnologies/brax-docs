# RACI & CODE-KS

To **maintain clarity and accountability**, we utilize the **RACI matrix for cross-department processes and the CODE-KS matrix for in-department processes.** These matrices help us track roles, responsibilities, and progress efficiently.

### RACI MATRIX

The RACI matrix is a snapshot of all the roles within a cross-department process. It allows us to track accountability and visualize who is responsible for tasks and make sure all assignments are running effectively. This way every member of a project can be informed and easily updated on the progress. It usually contains only 4 roles people can be assigned to, but in brax we have 6. They are:

<table data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> <mark style="color:blue;"><strong>R</strong></mark><strong>esponsible</strong><br>The person responsible for completing a task or project.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><strong>A</strong></mark><strong>ccountable</strong><br>The individual accountable for the overall execution of the task and final approval.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><strong>C</strong></mark><strong>onsulted</strong><br>Experts whose opinion is sought during the project.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><strong>I</strong></mark><strong>nformed</strong><br><strong>I</strong>ndividuals who need to be updated on the project's progress.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:purple;"><strong>S</strong></mark><strong>upport</strong><br>This is someone who offers support with some specific process or concept on the task.</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:purple;"><strong>K</strong></mark><strong>nowledge-Lead</strong><br>This is someone who's responsible for documenting and delivering training regarding a specific process.</td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>



### CODE-KS MATRIX

The CODE-KS matrix is used for in-department processes and it defines the accountability of each team member in every part of every process. An employee can be accountable for the process:
