# 📚 Knowledge Management Policy

> **Our philosophy:** We treat knowledge like a product. It should be easy to find, easy to use, and constantly improving.

---

## 🎯 The Goal

People do their best work when they aren't blocked by missing context. Our approach ensures the right answers live in the right place—so you don't have to:

- ❌ DM an expert for basic info
- ❌ Dig through old email threads
- ❌ Recreate work that's already been done

---

## ❌ What Didn't Work

**The old way created chaos:**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| 💬 Information scattered across chats | Hard to find answers |
| 🧠 Knowledge trapped in people's heads | Doesn't scale, creates bottlenecks |
| 🔄 Facts drift without single source of truth | Conflicting information, mistakes |

**Result:** Duplicate work, slow onboarding, avoidable mistakes.

---

## ✅ What We Do Instead

### Our Four Pillars

📝 **Write it down** → Default to written, searchable docs  
🗂 **Organize smartly** → Structure by audience and purpose (how-to, decisions, reference)  
👥 **Assign ownership** → Every page has an owner; stale content gets flagged  
🌐 **Share by default** → Public inside the company (sensitive docs clearly marked)

---

## 🤝 Culture Over Control

**We optimize for autonomy, not gatekeeping.**

- People are trusted to act with good judgment
- Sharing knowledge is part of everyone's job
- Capturing what you learn helps the whole team move faster

---

## 📊 Clear Expectations

Knowledge sharing is built into our growth frameworks. **To progress, you don't just ship—you also:**

✅ Document your decisions  
✅ Write how-to guides  
✅ Improve existing documentation  

---

## 🏠 Where Knowledge Lives

<div style="display: flex; gap: 2rem; margin: 1rem 0;">

### ✅ SHOULD Live Here
- Our central docs platform
- Clear titles and tags
- Assigned owners
- Searchable format

### ❌ SHOULD NOT Live Here
- Only in someone's head
- Buried in chat threads
- Forgotten PDF files
- Random email attachments

</div>

## 🔄 Keeping It Fresh

**Our maintenance strategy:**

📅 **Track freshness** → "Last reviewed" date and owner on every page  
📝 **Record decisions** → Document major choices (what we decided and why)  
🗁️ **Clean up regularly** → Archive or merge outdated pages (don't let them rot)

---

> 💡 **The payoff:** Good documentation reduces meetings, speeds up onboarding, and lets experts focus on hard problems—not repeating the same answers over and over.
