# 🎯 Culture Code

## Why Culture Matters

**Innovation is at the center of everything we do at brax.** To deliver meaningful innovation, we embrace diversity—bringing together bright minds from different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Our strength lies in this diversity, but our success depends on unity around shared values.

While we celebrate individual differences, we require alignment on core principles. Our Culture Code defines the essential values that unite our diverse community and guide us toward our shared mission.

## Permission to Play Values

Our Culture Code is built on **6 Permission to Play values**—the minimum standards of behavior we expect from everyone in our "free to create" environment.

These aren't aspirational ideals; they're **non-negotiable requirements**:
- We only hire people who demonstrate these values
- We don't tolerate employees who fail to exhibit these values
- These values apply equally to everyone, regardless of role or seniority

## When Culture Alignment Falters

We recognize that people are human. Even dedicated team members can occasionally lose focus, and sometimes culture mismatches slip through the hiring process. Technical excellence alone isn't enough—cultural fit matters equally.

**We believe in second chances.** People can change, and we've developed the [Corrective Action Plan (CAP)](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md) process to address culture misalignment constructively.

### How the CAP Works

The CAP provides a structured opportunity for realignment:

1. **Clarity** - We clearly identify the specific behaviors and attitudes that need improvement
2. **Ownership** - The employee creates their own action plan for change
3. **Reflection** - The process offers space to reflect on whether the role is the right fit
4. **Support** - We provide guidance and time to demonstrate change

This gives everyone a fair chance to realign with our culture before taking further measures.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** While we believe in growth and second chances, our Permission to Play values are non-negotiable. The CAP is an opportunity to course-correct, but continued misalignment with our core values will result in separation from the company.
