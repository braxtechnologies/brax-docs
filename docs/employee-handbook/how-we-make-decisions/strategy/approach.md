# 🎯 Approach to Strategic Management

## What Is Strategic Management?

**Strategic management is the ongoing planning, monitoring, analysis, and assessment of everything necessary for an organization to meet its goals and objectives.**

In today's fast-paced business environment, success depends on the ability to adapt to new challenges. We've developed an innovative approach to addressing adaptive challenges at the departmental level, with a **focus on clear communication and complete organizational visibility.**

## Our Approach

### Core Principles

Our strategic management methodology achieves ambitious objectives by:

- **Aligning** day-to-day work with strategic goals
- **Prioritizing** projects and products effectively
- **Monitoring** progress toward key performance indicators
- **Adapting** quickly to changing business needs

By emphasizing [context over control](context-not-control.md), we create a supportive environment that enables:
- Creativity and innovation
- Cross-functional collaboration
- Continuous improvement
- Team empowerment and autonomy

### Strategic Visibility for All

Our approach ensures that **every employee understands how their work contributes to the broader strategy**, regardless of their department or role. This transparency fosters engagement, accountability, and purpose-driven work.

## Project Management Framework

**Our Custom Project Management Tool**

We've built our own project management platform tailored specifically to our strategic management approach. This tool is designed to seamlessly integrate with our workflows and will be **made available as open source soon**, allowing other organizations to benefit from our approach.

### Project Categories

We organize work into three distinct project types, each with clear strategic alignment:

#### 1. Department Projects
**Focus**: Internal process improvement within a specific department

- Tasks directly related to improving departmental processes
- Linked to initiatives addressing adaptive challenges
- Owned and managed by department leadership

#### 2. Cross-Department Process Projects
**Focus**: Organization-wide process optimization

- Tasks involving processes that span multiple departments
- Company-wide initiatives requiring cross-functional collaboration
- Coordinated by senior leadership or designated project owners

#### 3. Product Projects
**Focus**: Product development and enhancement

- All product-related work including:
  - Bug fixing and technical debt
  - Feature development
  - Product stories and user experience improvements
  - Overall product quality enhancements

### Agile Methodology

We organize projects using **Kanban and Scrum boards** to ensure:
- Unified team alignment
- Transparent workflow visualization
- Consistent progress toward strategic goals
- Flexible adaptation to changing priorities

## When Control Is Necessary

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Balancing Context with Control**

While we emphasize [context over control](context-not-control.md), certain situations require direct oversight to ensure security and compliance:

**Control is required when:**

1. **Preventing Irrevocable Risks**
   - Data breach prevention
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Financial or legal exposure

2. **Supporting Learning and Development**
   - Junior employees require mentoring and guidance
   - New team members need onboarding oversight
   - Skill gaps necessitate closer supervision

3. **Addressing Escalated Conflicts**
   - Moral, ethical, or legal issues
   - Serious interpersonal conflicts
   - Situations requiring immediate intervention

In these scenarios, appropriate control measures protect both individuals and the organization while maintaining our culture of trust and empowerment.
