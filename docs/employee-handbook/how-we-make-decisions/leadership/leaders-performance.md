## 📊 How We Evaluate Leadership

{% hint style="info" %}
**Level & Step Reviews:** Before advancing, leaders go through thorough evaluations across four key criteria.
{% endhint %}

### The Four Leadership Criteria

1. 🛠️ **Technical Leadership**
2. 👥 **People Management Leadership**
3. 💼 **Business Leadership**
4. 🌀 **Adaptive Leadership**

Each criterion is split into two dimensions:

- **Completeness** → How well you build and maintain systems
- **Achievement** → What you deliver and accomplish

This framework gives us a complete picture of your capabilities and impact.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Leadership
**Primary focus: L1 Managers (Pace Setters)**

Technical Leadership is about your technical skills and know-how, closely tied to how you manage processes, knowledge, and teams.

### What We Look For

**Completeness** 📝  
How effectively do you manage processes? Can you establish, enhance, and adapt processes that drive efficiency and productivity?

**Achievement** 🎯  
Are you continuously improving your technical knowledge to meet evolving demands? We look at your performance and accountability in staying sharp and relevant.

## 👥 People Management Leadership
**Primary focus: L2 Managers (Coaches)**

In a dynamic workforce, understanding and effectively managing diverse people is everything.

### What We Look For

**Completeness** 🗺️  
Can you seamlessly map the right people to the right positions? This is about organizational design—aligning roles to achieve performance goals and complete projects successfully.

**Achievement** 🌱  
Are the right people in the right roles, and are they growing? Great coaches ensure everyone has opportunities for continuous development. When you nurture talent and empower people to thrive, the whole company rises with them.

## 💼 Business Leadership
**Primary focus: L3 Managers (Visionaries)**

Business Leadership is about finding opportunities, overcoming strategic challenges, and creating the right context for your team and stakeholders to succeed.

### What We Look For

**Completeness** 📝  
How well do you support strategic initiatives from conception to completion? Can you define, monitor, and report on KPIs? This measures your contribution to strategic planning and execution.

**Achievement** 🎯  
Does your team hit their KPIs and goals? We evaluate how you drive your team toward business objectives and deliver measurable outcomes through effective initiative execution.

### Capability Assessment

{% hint style="info" %}
**Capability Assessment** measures the likelihood your strategy will actually succeed. Can you assess your team's and division's ability to manage campaigns, business plans, projects, and initiatives—and then execute on them?
{% endhint %}

**Two dimensions of Capability Assessment:**

**🌐 General Factors**  
- Do you have the necessary technical knowledge for your role?
- Do you understand your team's domain?
- Can you assess how your team's technical knowledge fits within the broader company context?

**🏠 Internal Factors**  
- How well do you understand the company's unique identity, values, and offerings?
- Can you align your strategy with what makes brax... brax?

### Opportunity Finding

{% hint style="info" %}
**Opportunity Finding** is crucial for Business Leadership. Can you identify business opportunities and effectively address challenges?
{% endhint %}

**We evaluate this through two lenses:**

**🎯 Experience** → What have you learned by doing?  
The best learning happens on the job. Leaders who've navigated cross-departmental projects, engaged with stakeholders, and handled complex tasks understand how everything connects. We look for relevant experience that aligns with our business goals—people who bring valuable insights to our IT product landscape.

**🌍 Exposure** → How adaptable are you?  
In tech, adaptability is everything. Top leaders can reinvent themselves, stay current with market trends, and tackle new challenges. We assess your exposure to the unique challenges in our business domain. Even if you haven't faced our specific problems, we value proactive efforts to learn from similar situations.

**Bottom line:** Evaluating Business Leadership gives us clear insights into where leaders excel and where they can grow in driving organizational success.
