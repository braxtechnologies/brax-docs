# 👥 Management Framework

## Our Leadership Philosophy

At our organization, leadership means **serving the needs of people and the organization first**. This servant-leadership approach contrasts with traditional command-and-control models where leaders prioritize personal gain or influence. By putting people first, we ensure:

- **Autonomy** - Empowering teams to make decisions
- **Accountability** - Clear ownership and responsibility
- **Innovation** - Freedom to experiment and improve
- **High Performance** - Sustainable excellence through support
