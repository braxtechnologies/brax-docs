# 👭 Team Management

> **The foundation:** Effective team management isn't about control—it's about [Strategic Management](../strategy/strategic-management.md) paired with [Context, Not Control](../strategy/context-not-control.md).

---

## 🎯 The Challenge

As we grow exponentially, providing the right context for every team member gets harder. The solution? **Balance Strategic Management with strong Leadership.**

**Our leaders aren't just taskmasters—they're strategic thinkers** who guide teams toward common goals.

---

## 💪 Core Principles

We run teams based on three fundamental practices:

### 1. ✅ Accountability for Deliverables
Everyone knows their responsibilities. We hold ourselves accountable for meeting what we commit to.

### 2. 🔄 Following Up on Deliverables
Deliverables aren't "set and forget." We proactively track progress and provide support where needed.

### 3. 🎯 Coaching and Assistance
Leaders are here to help and coach, fostering a collaborative, growth-oriented environment.

## 🔒 Security Through Accountability

In tech, data breaches and leaks are constant threats. **Our defense?** Strong accountability between teams and individuals, backed by robust processes that prioritize data security.

When everyone knows their role and responsibilities, security becomes part of the culture—not just a policy.
