# Employee Probationary Period

#### Policy brief & purpose

This policy clarifies the rules, conditions, and expectations for employees during their probationary period.

#### Scope

This policy applies to all employees of our Company. The Company will make an effort to ensure that its hiring procedures serve the purpose of recruiting the best employees for each open position. The probation period gives both employees and employers enough time to find out if their new employment relationship will eventually work out to the benefit of both.

#### Policy Elements

**Employees on Probation**

Those who can be placed in an employee probationary period include the following&#x20;

* New employees
* Current employees who are promoted to another position, including but not only when it comes to a position of higher responsibility

The length of the probationary period is up to 6 months. It will be clearly stated in the employment contract. During the probation period, the parties shall have all rights and duties as under a final employment contract. In the probation period not included in the time during which the employee has been on statutory leave, or has not performed the work for which the contract has been concluded for other valid reasons. An employment contract with a probation period with the same employee of the Company for the same position may be concluded only once.

**Meaning of the Probation Period**

The probationary period is the time between signing an employment contract and being granted final employment status – i.e. till the employment contract signed is considered concluded for indefinite period of time or, as the case may be, concluded for the fixed period of time set forth in the contract (in case of a fixed-term contract with probation period). It is a “trial period” during which the employee is being evaluated as a suitable fit for the position and the Company. A trial period clause may be envisaged in contracts concluded for an unlimited period of time as well as in fix term contracts. The respective employee who is under probation period will be given consistent feedback and coaching to have the chance to learn their new job and improve during the probationary period.

Before the end of the probation period, the manager will determine if the employee should be retained in the organization. This decision will be made by appraising the following criteria:

* The skills, competencies, and knowledge of the employee on the job
* The employee’s progress on given assignments
* Their reliability, trustworthiness, and other relevant personality characteristics of the employee
* The employee’s relations and collaboration with subordinates, supervisors, and peers

However, the Company does not have the duty to justify its decision to retain the employee or not.

#### Procedure

* If the employee is deemed unsuitable while on a probationary period, the employee may be terminated without the minimum prior notice mandated by law or provided for in the individual employment contract.
* Termination may occur before the ending of the probationary period.
* The employee will be officially notified in writing for the decision to terminate them.
* Employees may still have to be dismissed for various reasons, after the end of the probationary period. In such cases, the company will follow labor law, legal guidelines, and its own separation of employment policy.

#### Policy violation

In case the employee does not comply with the conditions of our Probationary Period, the following action will be taken:

* Termination of Employment
