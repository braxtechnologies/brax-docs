# Cellphone

**Policy elements**

We allow the use of cell phones at work. Personal phone use is allowed for not more than 2 mins. This is to make sure you can take phone calls in case of an emergency related to your family. You must not get distracted from your work. You must not disturb the other people in the room by making personal phone calls. You need to always make them on your break. Employees use company-issued phones for business purposes only and preserve them in perfect condition.

We won’t allow employees to:

* Play games on the cell phone during working hours.
* Use their cell phone’s camera or microphone to record confidential information.
* Use their phones in areas where cell use is explicitly prohibited
* Speak on their phones within earshot of colleagues’ working space during working hours.
* Download or upload inappropriate, illegal or obscene material on a company cell phone using a corporate internet connection.

**Policy Violation**

Our company will monitor employees for excessive or inappropriate use of their cell phones. If an employee’s phone usage causes a decline in productivity or interferes with our operations, we’ll ban that employee from using their cell phones during working hours and the following action will be taken:

* Disciplinary action: if a minor violation
* Termination of Employment: if a severe violation

Examples of severe violations are:

* Cause a security breach.
