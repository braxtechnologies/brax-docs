# Corporate e-mail

**Policy Elements**

Corporate emails are powerful tools that help employees in their jobs. Employees should use their company email primarily for work-related purposes. We will define what constitutes appropriate and inappropriate use.

**Inappropriate use of company email**

Our employees represent our company whenever they use their corporate email address. They must not:

* Sign up for illegal, unreliable, disreputable or suspect websites and services.
* Send unauthorized marketing content or solicitation emails.
* Register for a competitor’s services unless authorized.
* Send insulting or discriminatory messages and content.
* Intentionally spam other people’s emails, including their coworkers.

Our company has the right to monitor and archive corporate emails.

**Appropriate use of the corporate email**

Employees are allowed to use their corporate email for work-related purposes without limitations to:

* Communicate with current or prospective customers and partners.
* Log in to purchased software they have legitimate access to.
* Give their email address to people they meet at conferences, career fairs or other corporate events for business purposes.
* Sign up for newsletters, platforms and other online services that will help them with their jobs or professional growth.

**Email security**

Email is often the medium of hacker attacks, confidentiality breaches, viruses, and other malware. These issues can compromise our reputation, legality, and security of our equipment. Employees must always be vigilant to catch emails that carry malware or phishing attempts. We instruct employees to:

* Avoid opening attachments and clicking on links when content is not adequately explained (e.g. “Watch this video, it’s amazing.”)
* Be suspicious of clickbait titles.
* Check the email and names of unknown senders to ensure they are legitimate.
* Look for inconsistencies or style red flags (e.g. grammar mistakes, capital letters, an excessive number of exclamation marks.)

If an employee isn’t sure that an email they received is safe, they can ask our System Administrators.

**Email signature**

We encourage employees to use the email signature from Secure Group that exudes professionalism and represents our company well. Employees dealing with sales and executives, who represent our company to customers and stakeholders should pay special attention to how they close emails.&#x20;

**Policy Violation**

In case the employee does not follow the Corporate email measures, the following action will be taken:

* Disciplinary action: if a minor violation
* Termination of Employment: if a severe violation

Examples of severe violations are:

* Using a corporate email address to send confidential data without authorization.
* Sending offensive or inappropriate emails to our customers, colleagues or partners.
* Using a corporate email for illegal activity.
