# Substance Abuse and Drug Testing Policy

#### Policy brief & purpose

brax is a drug and alcohol-free environment because we value the health and safety of all of your employees. We understand that any employee that may be working under the influence of alcohol or drugs could injure himself or other employees. We also believe that alcohol or drug impairment impacts all aspects of an employee’s life negatively. These negative impacts, such as broken families, cannot help but flow over into the workplace and manifest as absenteeism, lower productivity, and damaged relationships. This policy has the objective of explaining what are the measures that we take to avoid any substance or drug abuse.

#### Scope

All employees must abide by the provisions of this policy.

#### Policy Elements

Illegal drugs, prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs fall into the “substances” category. We also place restrictions on alcohol consumption. While working, it's extremely forbidden to:

* Possess, use or be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. You can consume alcohol in moderation while in approved business meetings or social gatherings.
* Sell, buy, transfer or distribute drugs.
* Abuse prescription drugs while at work.

#### Procedure

If there's any suspicion about drug or alcohol abuse in the workplace, we will ask the relevant employee to leave the office and to return the next day if there's a condition for that. Here are instances that constitute reasonable suspicion:

* Abnormal behavior.
* Physical evidence of drugs and alcohol or observation (including odors.)
* Patterns of failing to complete a task due to confusion or disorientation.
* Reports from colleagues that an employee admitted to using drugs, was seen using drugs or was shown to be under the influence at work.

If you see that your prescription drugs unexpectedly affect your senses, thinking or movements, please ask for time off. To ensure we enforce this policy, we ask managers to keep detailed, verifiable records of drug-related incidents, behaviors or reports.

#### Policy violation

In case the employee does not follow this policy, the following action will be taken:

* Corrective Action Plan ([CAP)](../../how-we-ensure-peoples-growth/performance/cap.md): if a minor violation
* Termination of Employment: if a frequent or severe violation

Note that if you become inebriated and behave inappropriately towards colleagues, customers or stakeholders, we will terminate your contract immediately.
