## Compensation Philosophy

### For Founders

Founder compensation at brax follows these guidelines:

1. **Market-aligned, not market-leading** — Salaries reflect industry standards for similar-stage companies
2. **Equity-focused** — The bulk of founder wealth is tied to long-term company success
3. **Sustainable** — Salaries balance personal needs with company financial health
4. **Performance-linked** — Compensation adjusts based on company milestones and growth

### How This Compares to Team Compensation

- Founders follow the same benefits structure as all employees
- No special perks or privileges beyond standard team benefits
- Bonus structures tied to company-wide performance metrics
- Stock options vest on the same schedule as team equity grants
