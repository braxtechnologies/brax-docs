  <h2 style="color: white; margin: 0 0 .5rem 0;">Fair, culture‑aligned, multi‑source feedback</h2>
  <p style="margin: 0; opacity: .95;">We combine peer, manager, direct report, and self feedback to evaluate performance and cultural alignment—grounded in brax’s Culture & Performance Framework.</p>

## 🎯 Why we use 360s

- Provide a well‑rounded view beyond a single manager perspective
- Detect blind spots and unlock development opportunities
- Reinforce our Culture Code with observable behaviors
- Tie recognition, coaching, and consequences to consistent signals

## 🧭 What we measure (mapped to Culture Code)

| Dimension | Culture principle | Example signals |
|---|---|---|
| Ownership (Responsibility) | Ownership Mentality | Delivers commitments, unblocks others, raises risks early |
| Transparency & Respect | Transparency & Radical Candor; Fairness & Integrity | Gives/receives feedback, shares context, honors commitments |
| Collaboration | Community Over Ego | Cross‑team handoffs, co‑creation, lifts team outcomes |
| Learning Agility | Continuous Learning | Experiments, learns from mistakes, documents decisions |
| Adaptiveness | Embracing Ambiguity | Performs in changing contexts, simplifies complexity |
| Remarkability (Impact) | Excellence & Craft | Raises quality bar, creates leverage, visible positive impact |
| Compliance (Binary checks) | Security, Ethics, Policy | Pass/fail for mandatory items (privacy, security, code of conduct) |

> Rubrics are maintained centrally; some dimensions include binary gates (must‑pass) for safety and compliance.

## 👥 Who contributes and why

| Source | What we ask for | How it’s used |
|---|---|---|
| Peers (cross‑functional) | Specific examples of collaboration, candor, reliability | Validate day‑to‑day behaviors and teamwork |
| Direct reports (if any) | Coaching, clarity, psychological safety | Assess people leadership and culture building |
| Manager | Outcomes, scope, role expectations | Align results with level rubric and strategy |
| Self | Achievements, lessons, intents | Capture context and growth narrative |
| Data (KPI/IT reports) | Throughput, quality, reliability signals | Anchor feedback in objective trends |

Note: Final decisions weigh multiple inputs—no single source decides alone.

## 📈 Scoring and decisions

- Rubric scale: 1 (Unsatisfactory), 2 (Needs Improvement), 3 (Meets), 4 (Exceeds), 5 (Exceptional)
- Binary gates (privacy/security/ethics) must be PASS for overall Passing outcome
- Evidence‑based: comments require examples or artifacts (links, IDs)

Outcomes align with the Culture & Performance Framework:

- ✅ Passing: strong performance and cultural alignment → recognition, growth opportunities
- 🟡 Redemption: gaps with potential → coaching plan via K‑POC; progress reviewed against milestones
- 🔴 Termination: persistent misalignment or severe violations → follow CAP process

## 🔒 Fairness and safety

- Peer feedback is anonymized in summaries; retaliation is prohibited
- Single‑reviewer bias checks during manager calibration
- Right to clarify: employees can add context in the self‑review and 1:1
