# Performance evaluation

Evaluations are done on-demand. If you feel you are ready to [Level Up or Step Up,](../../how-we-make-decisions/leadership/leaders-performance.md) you can request a Level & Step Review from your manager at any time you want. After the evaluation is completed, both the employee and manager will create a [K-POC](k-poc.md) in our system. K-POC stands for **Knowledge and Personal Objective Cycle** and it explains the improvements you need to make before the next evaluation. The K-POC does not have an explicit timeline so once you complete your K-POC, you can request another review.\
