# 🚀 Career Growth Paths

## Two Paths to Success

At brax, we recognize that people grow in different ways. We've designed **two distinct career paths** that offer equal opportunities for advancement, impact, and compensation:

---

### 🛠️ Individual Contributor (IC) Path

**[Explore IC Frameworks →](../../compensation/ic-frameworks/)**

The Individual Contributor path is designed for people who:

- **Excel through deep technical expertise** rather than people management
- Want to focus on developing specialized skills in their domain
- Prefer to make impact through their individual contributions
- May not want to manage people or prefer to develop those skills later

**What you'll develop:**
- Advanced technical and functional expertise
- Problem-solving and innovation capabilities
- Thought leadership in your domain
- Ability to influence through expertise

---

### 👥 Management Path

**[Explore Management Frameworks →](../../compensation/mgt-frameworks/)**

The Management path is designed for people who:

- **Thrive on developing and leading others**
- Want to build and guide high-performing teams
- Excel at strategic thinking and organizational impact
- Are passionate about people development and team performance

**What you'll develop:**
- Leadership and coaching skills
- Strategic planning and decision-making
- Team building and performance management
- Organizational and cultural influence

---

## Key Principles

### Equal Value, Different Focus

Both paths offer:
- **Clear development roadmaps** with defined levels and expectations
- **Competitive compensation** that rewards growth and impact
- **Career advancement opportunities** to the highest levels
- **Meaningful impact** on the organization's success

### Starting Point

**By default, all employees start as Individual Contributors** unless specified otherwise during hiring. This allows you to:
- Build a strong foundation in your functional area
- Understand the business and culture
- Make an informed decision about your career direction

### Switching Paths

**You can transition between paths** when:
- You reach **Level 3** as an Individual Contributor and want to explore management
- You meet the technical requirements for the new path
- There is an available opening in the desired path
- You demonstrate the core competencies required for the transition

**Path transitions are a career evolution, not a promotion.** Both paths are equally valued and offer distinct ways to grow your impact.
