# Individual Contributors Levels - Software Engineering

Software is at the heart of the organization and **our software engineers are the innovators who help to push the industry forward**. Apart from the standard Individual Contributor Paths, **they are also evaluated based on additional technical criteria**, outlined in the Software Engineering Complexity path.

The criteria involve competencies like writing, testing, and debugging code, as well as promoting best practices in their own work and across teams on matters like monitoring, architecture, and security.
