# Individual Contributors Steps

As we mentioned, the **Individual Contributor grid consists of Levels (1 to 6), and each Level is made of 4 Steps.** The Steps are separated into **Ownership**, which defines the current contribution of an employee in their role, and **Initiative**, which outlines what their intentions and goals should be, at their particular level.

**Ownership**

An ownership mindset is the willingness to think big and deliver better and in a manner that adds value to the business. The essence is taking accountability not just for your own deeds but for everyone in our operating system, enabling everyone to win.

**Initiative**

Initiative is the ability to be resourceful and work without always being told what to do. It requires resilience and determination. People who show initiative demonstrate they can think for themselves and act when necessary. It requires using your head and having the drive to achieve.
