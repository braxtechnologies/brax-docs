# Management Path

So, we have learned that brax has managers at four levels: L1, our pace setters; L2, our coaches; L3, our visionaries; and L4, our transformational leaders. Each level has four steps that a leader can grow into. We also have our [Tech leads](../../../../how-we-make-decisions/leadership/tech-leads.md) who are our leaders in terms of operations.\
\
To progress within our organization, leaders have **two pathways for advancement:** \
A. **Level Up,** which aligns with the nature of their role, or\
B. **Step Up,** which reflects their performance as managers.&#x20;

In the Management Path, there are also four steps per level that you can grow into. To move up from one step to the other it’s evaluated the authority and involvement regarding:

We currently have four Levels for our Management Path. Each one of the levels is expected to have different leadership traits as we explored in the chapter [Leadership.](../../../../how-we-make-decisions/leadership/)

It's essential to foster a culture that encourages them to continuously strive for growth and aim higher, facilitating their transition from one Level or Step to the next.&#x20;

Regardless of their Level or Step, we believe **leaders have a crucial role in the operation of an orgnization.** Just as with other employees, they should be held accountable for their work and their performance, and only through excelling at their tasks can they rise up the Management Path. **The requirements are challenging, but only because excellent leadership is so important to the industry landscape.**&#x20;

* **Technical Leadership**
* **Business Leadership**
* **People Management Leadership**
* **Adaptive Leadership**

**Technical Leadership** refers to the ability to anticipate and find solutions for technical challenges. It's completely related to our Process Management and Team Management and strategies.

In this perspective we created two definitions: Completeness and Achievement.

Completeness refers to setting-up, improving and adapting processes in order to cover all aspects of our business. In terms of knowledge it's related to ensuring that all the set of knowledge in the company is mapped, defined, covered and with ceremonies defined for structured communication.

Achievement on the other hand is guaranteeing the teams are accountable for the company's processes and constantly improving and applying the needed technical knowledge and communicating effectively for us to have competitive advantage.

**Business Leadership -** this refers to managing our strategy, overcoming strategic challenges, and setting up context for subordinates and stakeholders. Here we defined two categories:

* Completeness

Completeness refers to the leader's involvement in creating and completing strategic maps, defining, monitoring, and reporting initiatives and KPIs.

* Achievement

Achievement is all about the teams achieving KPIs, strategic goals, and maps through successful initiatives execution. This includes Capability Assessment and Opportunity Finding.

_Capability Assessment (part of the Achievement category)_

It's defined by the likelihood of success and execution of strategy based on capability management and understanding. That refers to leaders' ability to excel in their core duties based on effectively assessing their team's and division's capability to manage campaigns, business plans, projects, initiatives, and achieve business goals. It's divided into two sub-categories:

* General Factors

Owning the technical knowledge needed for the role, understanding the team's and/or division domain and the feasibility of their team's and/or division's technical knowledge, and the needed technical knowledge at a company level.

* Internal Factors

The leaders' brax Knowledge in terms of who we are as a company and what we offer.

_Opportunity Finding (part of the Achievement category)_

To be capable of finding business opportunities and tackling our challenges we defined two sub-categories that our leaders should succeed: Experience and Exposure.

* Experience

The majority of people's learning and knowledge comes from on-the-job experiences that equip them with the opportunity to discover and develop job-related skills, address challenges, and learn from their mistakes. Through working in cross-department projects, contact with stakeholders, and complex tasks, leaders build the knowledge of how their role reflects on and is affected by the roles of others.

* Exposure

Refers to the ability of leaders to reinvent themselves when facing changes, market and industry knowledge, the leader's level of exposure to our challenges, and ability/ approach to solve them.

**People management (or sometimes called Career Management)** refers to the ability of the leader to place the people with the right set of skills and knowledge in the team and to help them grow.

In this perspective, completeness relates to having all the necessary positions in the company mapped so we can achieve our goals. It also includes if the performance evaluations and career pathing are done on-time and according to our Management Model.

Achievement refers to ensuring we have high-performers filling the needed positions in the teams and that they are constantly developing and growing.

\
A lot of times in our "Context, not Control" environment, as we mentioned, chaos tend to arise motivated by constant change. The **Adaptive Leadership refers** to the ability of our leaders to successfully conduct the teams during such moments in which the technical knowledge will not be the solution for the challenges.

These moments require the teams to adapt and usually involve a change of mindset and/or attitude, but that is easier said than done, since each person tend to react differently to changes.

In this scenario we considered 6 perspectives:
