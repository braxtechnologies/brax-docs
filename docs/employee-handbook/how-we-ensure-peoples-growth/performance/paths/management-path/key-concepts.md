### Core Duties

* Level 1 managers are responsible for coordinating processes and stakeholders which means their main differentiator is Technical Leadership.

  * Level 2 Step 1 and Step 2 managers are still involved in the operation and execution of their department's processes while Level 2 Step 3 and Step 4 are responsible for process management on a higher level of report, design, automation, and monitoring.
