## **The State of Technology Today**

Technology has transformed every aspect of our lives, yet the systems that power it have drifted far from their promise. In an age when our devices know more about us than our closest friends, the industry that builds them too often treats people as products, not participants.

Closed ecosystems limit choice and freedom. Devices are intentionally designed to fail or become obsolete, forcing users into endless upgrade cycles. Personal data is harvested and traded as currency. Meanwhile, the environmental cost of this cycle—mountains of e-waste, resource depletion, and carbon-intensive production—continues to rise.

At **Brax Technologies**, we refuse to accept this status quo. We believe technology should uplift people, not exploit them. It should last longer, respect privacy, and remain open to improvement. Our mission is to **build a better tech future—one rooted in openness, choice, security, and transparency.**

## **A Different Kind of Tech Company**

Brax Technologies was founded on a radical idea: that ethical, sustainable, and user-centered technology isn’t just possible—it’s necessary.

As a **Public Benefit Corporation (PBC)**, our mission is written into our legal DNA. This means we’re not driven solely by profit, but by purpose. Our charter obligates us to balance the interests of our shareholders with those of our users, communities, and the planet. It’s a public commitment to doing what’s right, even when it’s not the most profitable route.

Our status as a PBC formalizes what our manifesto already implies: that **technology must serve the public good**. Every decision we make—from sourcing materials to writing code—is guided by our responsibility to people and the planet. Our success isn’t measured by quarterly earnings alone, but by the positive impact we have on digital freedom, privacy, and sustainability.

We build products that put users first. Devices designed to empower, not control. Technology that invites trust, collaboration, and transparency. **Brax Technologies is not just another company—it’s a movement** to reclaim what technology was always meant to be: a tool for human progress.

## **Our Core Beliefs**

### **1. Freedom of Choice Empowers People**

Technology should never dictate your choices. We build devices that work across multiple operating systems, giving users the ability to choose software that matches their values and needs. Whether you want open-source flexibility, privacy-focused security, or minimal digital footprint, **your device should adapt to you—not the other way around.**

### **2. Privacy Is a Universal Right**

Privacy is not a luxury feature—it’s a fundamental human right. Everyone deserves access to technology that protects personal data and refuses to exploit it. We ensure our products support privacy-first systems and tools without sacrificing usability or affordability. You shouldn’t have to compromise safety for convenience.

### **3. Security Should Be Transparent and Rigorous**

Trust begins with openness. Our security practices are grounded in **open, peer-reviewed standards** that invite external scrutiny. By exposing our methods to the global tech community, we ensure robust protection that can be verified, not just claimed. Real security doesn’t hide behind secrecy—it thrives in transparency.

### **4. Sustainability Is Non-Negotiable**

Innovation means nothing if it destroys the planet. Every Brax product is designed for **durability, repairability, and longevity**. We support a circular economy by reducing waste, extending device lifespans, and providing the tools users need to repair rather than replace. Our goal is not to sell more devices—it’s to make devices that last.

### **5. Transparency Builds Trust**

We go beyond glossy marketing. Brax Technologies is committed to **radical transparency**—sharing detailed documentation about how our products are built, tested, and maintained. Users deserve to understand every step, from supply chain to firmware. Because when you know how something works, you can trust it.

### **6. Collaboration Drives Progress**

No single company can fix technology alone. That’s why we partner with open-source developers, nonprofits, and ethical innovators who share our vision. Collaboration fuels progress, and when we share knowledge and profits with those who build the future, we make the entire ecosystem stronger.

## **From the Founders**

### **Robert Braxman – Co-Founder**

Known to many as *“The Internet Privacy Guy,”* Robert Braxman has long been a leading voice in the fight against digital surveillance. As a public-interest technologist and privacy advocate, Robert has dedicated his career to exposing how mass data collection erodes individual freedom—and how open, transparent systems can restore it.

His philosophy is simple: privacy is not paranoia, it’s protection. Through Brax Technologies, Robert is turning that philosophy into tangible, everyday tools for people who refuse to be tracked.

### **Dominic Gingras – Co-Founder**

Dominic Gingras is a veteran of the secure communications world. As the founder and former CEO of Secure Group, he led teams that built some of the most trusted mobile technologies in government and enterprise security. Today, his focus has shifted from institutions to individuals—bringing the same level of protection once reserved for the few to people everywhere.

Dominic’s vision for Brax Technologies is rooted in empowerment: *to give everyone the ability to own, understand, and secure their technology.*

### **Plamen Todorov – Co-Founder**

A master of mobile hardware and user-centered design, Plamen Todorov brings technical precision and human empathy together. His experience in designing custom mobile technologies is guided by a deep belief that hardware should serve people—not corporations. Plamen’s work ensures that every device we make reflects our mission: ethical, open, and accessible to all.

## **A Call to the Industry**

We’re not here to compete with the giants—we’re here to change the game.
The world doesn’t need more shiny devices or empty slogans about innovation. It needs **ethical technology**—tools that protect privacy, empower users, and respect the planet.

As a **Public Benefit Corporation**, we are bound—legally and morally—to pursue this mission. That means transparency isn’t just a brand value; it’s a responsibility. It means user freedom isn’t an option; it’s our mandate. It means we answer not just to shareholders, but to every person who believes in a fairer, freer digital future.

At Brax Technologies, we’re inviting users, developers, and visionaries to join us in this movement. The more we share, the stronger we become. Together, we can rebuild the mobile tech industry into something we’re proud of—a future where **freedom, security, and sustainability** are not afterthoughts, but foundations.
